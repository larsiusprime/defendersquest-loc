$ENTRY_JOURNAL_INTRO_TITLE							
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_INTRO_LEFT_00	Den 1 - Kde to jsem?						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_INTRO_LEFT_10	Asi jsem se zbláznila, ale přesto se pokusím zaznamenat události, které se odvíjejí před mýma očima. Čtenári nechť z toho vyvozují, co je jim libo - já budu pouze popisovat události tak, jak je ve své horečnaté mysli chápu.<N>Jedno vím jistě - taky jsem chytla ten mor, který sužuje naše hlavní město. Vím také, že jsem byla, stejně jako ostatní nemocní přede mnou, vyhnána z města a vržena do Jámy. Pak následoval tak zvláštní a hrůzný sled událostí, že stále váhám, zda sním či bdím.<N>Když mi horečka zatemnila mysl, ocitla jsem se na jakémsi temném místě. Přede mnou stála další oběť.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_INTRO_RIGHT_00	Objevil se veliký trůn a na nem seděl muž, že podobného jsem v živote neviděla. Byl úplně celý ze zlata. Nejdřív jsem si myslela, že to musí být socha, ale najednou pronesl jakýsi rozkaz.<N>I jeho hlas působil zlatě a měl hromovou ozvěnu. Promluvil jazykem, s jakým jsem se nikdy v celé velké knihovně v Ashi nesetkala, ale moje tělo přesto vyskočilo. Žíly mi naběhly, jako by i moje krev chtěla vyrazit z mého těla a přidat se k němu.<N>Doteď se mi divoce rozbuší srdce, kdykoliv si na to vzpomenu.<N>-[mcguffin_hero] Livbar						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_TITLE							
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_LEFT_0_00	Noc 1 - [berserker_hero]						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_LEFT_0_10	Když mám psát o berserkovi jménem [berserker_hero], zjištuji, že prostě nejde vyjadřovat se jako slušný měšťan - automaticky přecházím na mluvu odpovídající tématu. [berserker_hero] je prostě trouba. A ještě je úplně dutej.<N>Co mu chybí na rozumu, to mu příroda nadělila na smradu. Kdyby se dvě hromady hořícího trusu spářily a zplodily smrdutého potomka, i ten by si zacpával nos, aby se uchránil puchu z jeho podpaždí. I ty smrduté chodící mrtvoly, co nás pronásledují, jsou oproti němu jako parfém.<N>Jenže ten trouba [berserker_hero] je taky roztomile šílený. Jeho charisma je neodolatelné, způsobem, který bych nazvala “šáhlý jako spodky na hlavě”.<N>Včera se patnáct minut hádal se šutrem, o který si ukopl palec. A prohrál.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_RIGHT_0_00	Je to radost, cestovat v takové společnosti.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_RIGHT_0_10	Den 3 - Přídavek						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_RIGHT_0_20	Abych byla fér, musím taky přiznat, že je to nejodvážnější člověk, jakého znám. Jeho tělo je jedna velká pavučina jizev z boje - i když pravda, trochu tomu přispívá fakt, že odmítá nosit na těle jakékoliv brnění. Můžu to shrnout asi takhle - je to naprosto nesnesitelný trouba a překvapivě schopný bojovník - a já jsem neskonale šťastná, že mi dělá doprovod.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_RIGHT_0_30	TAKY TĚ MILUJU! XOXOXO<N>							<N>JÁ NESPÍM, JEN SE PROTAHUJU VLEŽE, POSILUJE MI TO SVALSTVO NA ZADKU
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_RIGHT_0_40	Hmm, zjevně taky umí číst a psát! Kde se sakra takový krvelačný vandrák a budižkničemu dokázal vzdělat?<N><N>P.S. A jestli mi ještě někdy ukradneš deníček, udělám ti ve spánku lobotomii.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_LEFT_1_00	Noc 3 - druhý přídavek						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_LEFT_1_10	Zjištění: [berserker_hero] spí nahý. Všechny pokusy o pomstu se od teď budou odehrávat za dne. A ne, ty jizvy nekončí tam, kde začínají kalhoty.<N><N><N>Nesnáším tě.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_LEFT_1_20	CO? TY MYSLÍŠ, ŽE CHÁN S CHARISSOU SE NIKDY NEHÁDALI?						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_PRISON_TITLE							
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_PRISON_LEFT_0_00	Den 3 - Vězení						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_PRISON_LEFT_0_10	Před třemi dny jsem si myslela, že Jáma je vězení. Teď už vím, že i v Pekle je nějaké horší místo.<N>Muž, který nás uvěznil, se jmenuje Ozimal Kaz. Je to krutý malý odporný hajzlík. Jak se vůbec může normální člověk takhle neodpustitelně zkazit, to je nad moje chápání.<N>Čekala bych to od nějakého Quaida, který strávil posledních dvacet let pilováním své krutosti ve východních provinciích. I ti nejhorší nomádští náčelníci dokážou svoje záchvaty vzteku ovládat lépe, než tahle degenerovaná zrůda.<N>A to je podle přízvuku z hlavního města. Tohle monstrum vyrostlo ve stínu samotného Chrámu!						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_PRISON_RIGHT_0_00	Sedím tady s dalšími vězni. Sebrali je bez rozmyslu: banditi, lapkové, muži, ženy, děti... Ashané, nomádi, Quaidové, všichni čekají na smrt z rukou toho parchanta.<N>Dnem i nocí posloucháme nekonečné skučení jeho Navrátilců, ohlušující kakofonii narušenou jen smrtelnými výkřiky jejich poslední oběti. A já tu jen bezmocně sedím! Kdybych tak mohla být venku v aréně s těmi chudáky, aspoň bychom mohli bojovat o život.<N>Jak je Ozimal krutý, přesto se zjevně bojí mě zkusit podruhé popravit. Možná má strach, že by přišel o mnoho ze svých Navrátilců - nedají se zrovna snadno pochytat a vydržovat, a on je nutně potřebuje, aby mohl ve svém prťavém království držet svoje poddané na uzdě.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_PRISON_LEFT_1_00	Slova toho tajemného muže mi pořád zní v mysli. Ozimal chce předvést moje schopnosti nějakému “muži v červeném”. Kdo to je, tenhle muž v červeném? A kdo je ten tajemný cizinec, co se mi snaží pomoct? Proč jsem pro někoho tak důležitá?<N>V téhle záplavě otázek jsem si jistá jen jednou věcí: dosud jsem použila násilí jen proti těm, co už byli mrtví - ale jestli se mi někdy dostane Ozimal do rukou, už to nebude pravda.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_HALFWAY_WORLD_TITLE							
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_HALFWAY_WORLD_LEFT_0_00	Den 4 - Svět na půli cesty						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_HALFWAY_WORLD_LEFT_0_10	“Svět na půli cesty” je asi nejlepší způsob, jak prostými slovy popsat to místo, kde se ocitám - a kam jsem schopna vtáhnout ostatní.<N>Jednou, když jsem byla hodně malá, skoro jsem se utopila při plavání v mělčinách Kevelu. To je asi jediná zkušenost, ke které to můžu přirovnat. Stejná panika, stejná dusivá agónie, kdy se mi srdce snaží vyskočit z těla. Ale tentokrát tu nebude ruka mého otce, co mne vytáhne do bezpečí, nebude tu břeh, kterého se můžu chytit - jen ten okamžik smrti natažený k věčnosti.<N>Způsob, jak se tam dostávám, mi není jasný. Vím jen, že tam jdu, když tam potřebuju jít. A když tam jsem, můžu se natáhnout pro své blízké - ne jako bych je viděla, ale stejně, jako ovládám svoje končetiny, aniž bych se na ně koukala.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_HALFWAY_WORLD_RIGHT_0_00	Prostě jen vím, že tu jsou, a přivolám je silou, kterou mám. Té síly není moc, připadám si jako kojenec, který sotva hýbe rukama, ale je jí dost na to, aby mi zachránila život. A ačkoliv tu cestu do světa na půli cesty opravdu nesnáším, je to mnohem lepší než osud, který by mne čekal bez ní.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_KETTA_TITLE							
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_KETTA_LEFT_0_00	Den 5 - [ranger_hero]						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_KETTA_LEFT_0_10	[ranger_hero]? No, asi nejvíc na ní mám ráda, že zapáchá po kozách.<N>Chci říct, je to těžká volba, když další možnosti jsou nespoutaná nedospělost, neustálé ponižující narážky, přitroublý sarkasmus, kleptománie a odporné zvyky při stolování. Ale když s někým sdílíte stan, pronikavá kozina prostě všechno přetluče.<N>Někdy v noci vítr z pánské části tábora přivane ten nezapomenutelný zápach - [berserker_hero]. Když se smíchá s tou kozinou, nedá se to slovy popsat. Za takových nocí spím nejlépe, protože moje tělo raději zvolí bezvědomí, než by se snažilo vyrovnat se s náporem aromatických stimulů.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_KETTA_RIGHT_0_00	Den 8 - Přídavek						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_KETTA_RIGHT_0_10	Minulou noc mě [ranger_hero] vzbudila řevem v nomádštině. Zhruba by se to dalo přeložit jako “Ty ženská nevalných morálních kvalit, on je můj!". Vytrhla mi chomáč vlasů, strčila si je pod polštář a okamžitě zase hluboce usnula.<N>[ranger_hero] byla ráno nezvykle pokorná, omlouvala se tak intenzivně, že mi i ukázala, jak si do vlasů vplést žíně a zamaskovat to holé místo. Tvrdí, že nemá tušení, co v jejích snech způsobilo ten výlev emocí. Moc tomu nevěřím.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_AZRA_BY_SLAK_TITLE							
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_AZRA_BY_SLAK_LEFT_0_00	Den 10 - [mcguffin_hero] je trouba!						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_AZRA_BY_SLAK_LEFT_0_10	TAK TY SI MYSLÍŠ, ŽE KDYŽ BUDEŠ PSÁT JAKO STARÁ KNIHA, NEPOZNÁM, ŽE PÍŠEŠ O MNĚ?<N>NO, PRINCEZNIČKO, TO SES ŠEREDNĚ SPLETLA! TAK TEĎ JEDEN ZÁZNAM DO DENÍKU O TOBĚ!<N>TAKŽE, [mcguffin_hero_up], CO ŘÍCT? JEJÍ KSICHT JE TAK HUBENÝ, ŽE VYPADÁ JAKO RYBA? A MÁ KE SVÉMU TĚLU STRAŠLIVĚ DLOOOOOUHÝ KRK? A JEJÍ UŠI VYPADAJÍ JAKO USCHLÉ MERUŇKY? A MÁ NEMOŽNÝ ÚČES, JAKO KOŠTĚ. A JEJÍ OSOBNÍ HYGIENA NENÍ ZDALEKA TAK DOKONALÁ, JAK SI MYSLÍ.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_AZRA_BY_SLAK_RIGHT_0_00	JAK SE TI TO ČTE, LAMO? TEĎ ASPOŇ VÍM, KDO JSOU MOJI OPRAVDOVÍ PŘÁTELÉ.<N><N>S POZDRAVEM,<N>[ranger_hero_up] CO ŽERE LEJNA. [berserker_hero_up]? PROČ TI TRVÁ TAK DLOUHO NAPSAT MOJE JMÉNO?						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_KARSK_BURNED_TITLE							
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_KARSK_BURNED_LEFT_0_00	Noc 7 - Vypálení Karsku						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_KARSK_BURNED_LEFT_0_10	Smrt pro mne není nic nového. Za posledních devět měsíců morové epidemie v hlavním městě jsem přišla o veškerou dětskou naivitu a iluze, které jsem snad díky svému postavení mohla mít. Ale ještě nikdy jsem neviděla takhle surovou destrukci. I ty hořící hromady mrtvol před Chrámem jsou proti tomuhle nic.<N>Prostě nemám slov.<N>Začínám trochu rozumět tomu, co jsou naši nepřátelé zač.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_LAKSOS_TITLE							
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_LAKSOS_LEFT_0_00	Den 8 - Laksos						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_LAKSOS_LEFT_0_10	V Laksosu jsme byli svědky prapodivného nomádského rituálu. Náčelníkovi Karadů, malého místního kmene, se narodilo dítě. Položili je před dvě velké dřevené sochy.<N>Náčelník vzal kousek dřeva, nejdřív ho položil na každou sochu, pak dítěti na hlavu. Vyndal malý nožík a opatrně začal dřevo vyřezávat. Třísky tomu mrňousovi padaly do tváře. Když byl hotov, přivázal to dřevo na šňůrku ze zvířecích šlach a pověsil děcku kolem krku.<N>Celý dav pak zakřičel a dal se do tance a zaříkávání, pro nomády typického. Neviděla jsem vůbec, co vlastně náčelník z toho dřeva vyřezal.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_LAKSOS_RIGHT_0_00	[ranger_hero] mi pak místo odpovědi, co ten rituál znamenal, ukázala malou dřevenou lišku, kterou měla na krku pod oblečením. Řekla, že duch té sošky je sluhou kmenových bohů a při narození je dítěti věnován jako strážce a doprovod, který je dovede životem až do smrti a pomůže mu na cestě do Ráje. Stejně tak, jako byli kmenoví bohové věnováni kmeni Stvořitelem, tihle duchové jsou věnováni jednotlivým členům kmene při narození.<N>Když jsem se zeptala, jestli ztratit tu malou modlu z krku je pro jednotlivce tak hrozné, jako pro kmen přijít o svoje modly, [ranger_hero] se usmála a vytáhla z kapsy sedm dalších malých sošek s vysvětlením, že tihle její nepřátelé tráví po smrti dlouhé roky hledáním cesty do Ráje bez pomoci. Na můj dotaz, zda jí nevadí, že něco takového způsobila jiným nomádum, mi věnovala skelný pohled a zeptala se mě, jestli mi nevadí, že mám na svoji hlavu hrozně velké uši. A pak odešla, zpívajíc si o pojídání kozích ocasů. Jednou ji vezmu šutrem přes hlavu.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_OZIMAL_DEAD_TITLE							
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_OZIMAL_DEAD_LEFT_0_00	Den 10 - Ozimalova smrt						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_OZIMAL_DEAD_LEFT_0_10	Myslela jsem si, že Ozimalova smrt pro mne bude aspoň malou satisfakcí. Nebyla.<N>Byl jen jedním z mnoha tupě pochodujících těl, ohnutých k vůli našeho nepřítele, jen pěšcem na šachovnici. Svět přišel o zlého a prohnaného člověka. Všimne si toho tady v Jámě vubec někdo?						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MONASTERY_TITLE							
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MONASTERY_LEFT_0_00	Noc 10 - Klášter						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MONASTERY_LEFT_0_10	Asi to byla hloupost očekávat tady v Jámě něco, co by mi aspoň trochu připomnělo domov. Ale stejně mě klášter Selini šokoval. Je to obrovská, impozantní stavba, spíš pevnost než chrám. Chápu, že je to nutné, ale těžko to jde dohromady s mojí vzpomínkou na Fontánu Chrámu, u které jsem vyrůstala, kde i stráže nosí jen palcáty a jiné tupé zbraně, aby v místu zrození harmonie ani v případě jejich použití nerozsévali chaos a destrukci.<N>Jak uklidňující je ten pocit, ponořit ruce do Fontány s vědomím, že na tomhle místě stáli přede mnou všichni věřící, i kdysi dávno samotný Selinadt. Zde jsem jen prostý služebník, ale od králů i proroků mě odděluje jen čas.<N>“Jako se voda zvedá nad údolím coby mlha, padá na pohoří coby sníh, a v řekách pak spěchá dolů do moře, tak i každý člověk, zrozen ze stejné esence, musí sloužit						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MONASTERY_RIGHT_0_00	v různých rolích dle svého postavení, aby dosáhl harmonie s Nebeským Strojem.”<N>To jsem zvědavá, jakou roli mám hrát v tomhle hrozném místě, kde harmonie a moudrost jsou vzdálené fantazie.<N>Ale tahle pevnost-chrám přece nabízí jakousi útěchu. Neslouží snad mniši svému účelu? Ty mohutné zdi a zbraně jsou jen nutným přizpůsobením, aby bylo možno sloužit Selinadtovu duchu v tomhle bezvládí.<N>A sám velký Selinadt přece řekl: “Pravda zůstane pravdou, ať je napsána v jakémkoliv jazyce.” A tato opevnění nejsou nic jiného, než jazyk Jámy; pravda uvnitř zůstává.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_BAKAL_TITLE							
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_BAKAL_LEFT_0_00	Den 11 - [healer_hero]						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_BAKAL_LEFT_0_10	Otec [healer_hero] je oázou rozumu v záplavě chaosu. Spěch našeho útěku nedává mnoho prostoru pro konverzaci, ale i těch pár slov, která jsme stihli prohodit, mi hodně zvedlo náladu.<N>Kéž bych mu mohla stejně posloužit. Žere ho nejaký vnitřní boj. Občas to na jeho jinak poklidné mnišské tváři vidím. Je zjevné, že kdysi byl vojákem. Jizvy, postoj i chování to prozrazují.<N>V klášteře jsem se dozvěděla, že vlastně není kněz, ačkoliv mu všichni říkají Otče. Vlastně nemá žádnou oficiální pozici - ale lidé se na něj často obracejí s prosbou o radu, jako by byl představeným kláštera. Dokonce i skutečný představený se k němu chová skoro jako učedník.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_BAKAL_RIGHT_0_00	[healer_hero] z našeho putování zjevně čerpá inspiraci a náboj, jako by mu šlo o život. Už chápu, proč se ho [ranger_hero] bojí. Občas v jeho očích vidím odhodlání snad porovnatelné jen s tím, které mají naši pronásledovatelé. Jen se modlím, aby se mu jednoho dne podařilo najít pro svoji duši takový klid, který dokáže dávat ostatním.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_WRENNA_TITLE							
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_WRENNA_LEFT_0_00	Den 13 - <mage_hero_fu>						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_WRENNA_LEFT_0_10	Polimonův popis quaidské královské rodiny rozhodně nepřehání. [mage_hero] je vskutku “bledší než měsíc a dvakrát tak vzdálená”.<N>A já bych dodala “a pekelně náladová”. Ještě jsem nikdy nepotkala někoho, kdo by tak rychle procházel tolika fázemi šílenství. I [berserker_hero] je ve svém bláznovství aspoň konzistentní. [mage_hero] je bouřící oceán. V jednu chvíli pusobí ďábelsky chytře a vzápětí beznadějně naivně.<N>Často to vypadá, že to, co dělá, je dobře nacvičený trik - a když už jsem si tím skoro jistá, chytne ji nějaké nebezpečné šílenství a chová se naprosto iracionálně. Občas si říkám, že za tím vším šílenstvím je dívka jako já, vystrašená, osamocená a přitom vládnoucí až děsivou mocí. Nevím, jestli tohle také vidí.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_NOMADS_TITLE							
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_NOMADS_LEFT_0_00	Den 14 - Nomádi						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_NOMADS_LEFT_0_10	Bylo hrozně zajímavé potkat tolik nomádských kmenů zblízka, lidi obývající stepi a hory mezi městy Ashe a Quaidským císařstvím. Kantimal Polimon během své velké výpravy zdokumentoval více než sto kmenů, i když některé z nich pravděpodobně smetly hrůzy války. Tady v Jámě jsem se potkala se členy dvaceti sedmi* různých kmenů. Kolik jich přežilo tam venku, to nikdo neví.<N>Tyhle kmeny žijí kočovným životem, migrují se svými stády ovcí a koní přes stepi. Pro život v Jámě, kde ochrana znamená především trvalé opevnění, moc schopností nemají.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_NOMADS_LEFT_0_20	*Méně než půlka dnes funguje jako samostatné kmeny.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_NOMADS_RIGHT_0_00	Fungující kmeny zakládají vesnice, jako byl Karsk, přežívají díky stádům koz a primitivnímu zemědělství.<N>Volní nomádi (ti, jejichž kmeny byly zničeny nebo se rozprchly) nacházejí úkryt v kosmopolitních vesnicích jako je Laksos, nebo se stávají lovci, převážejí zprávy a ochraňují obchodní cesty mezi vesnicemi v Jámě.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DREAM1_TITLE							
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DREAM1_LEFT_0_00	Den 15 - Divný sen						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DREAM1_LEFT_0_10	Už dlouho jsem neměla žádný sen. Hrozné zážitky ze světa na půli cesty naplňují moji mysl natolik, že ve spánku pro jejich ozvěny nezbývá místo na snění. Přesto, včerejší noci, poprvé od mých horečnatých vizí z počátku mé nemoci, se mi zdál sen.<N>Byl tak intenzivní, že z mé mysli dokázal vyhnat všechny ty nedávno prožité hrůzy. A vlastně i všechny další zážitky z mých 23 let života.<N>Stála jsem na balkóně, vysoko. Nebyla jsem to já. Moje ruce byly temné a silné, pokryté divnými symboly, na zápěstí zlaté náramky. Moje šaty hýřily takovými drahokamy, že bohatství celého národa by stačilo jen na lem.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DREAM1_RIGHT_0_00	Měsíc visel na obloze nízko, veliký a žhavě červený, vypadal, že bych na něj dosáhla konečky prstů.<N>Nějaký hlas mne oslovil a já se za ním otočila. Vedle mne stál na balkóně muž. Byl vysoký, vyšší než jsem kdy viděla. Jeho vlasy a vousy byly černé jako noc, dlouhé a zdobené zlatými prstýnky. V jeho přítomnosti jako by okolní svět zbledl a scvrkl se.<N>Podíval se na mne onyxovýma očima a já pochopila, že jsme jedno. Přitáhla jsem ohnivý měsíc a rozdělila ho mezi nás.<N>Vzbudila jsem se, třásla se jako osika, ruku přitisklou k hrudi, jako bych ještě držela ten půlměsíc. Zmocnila se mne taková touha, až jsem se rozplakala. V tu chvíli bych dala všechno na světě za možnost se do toho snu vrátit.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DESERT_FORTRESS_TITLE							
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DESERT_FORTRESS_LEFT_0_00	Den 17 - Klenot Pouště						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DESERT_FORTRESS_LEFT_0_10	Vždycky jsem si říkala, jak asi vypadají domovy našich nepřátel na východě. Válka byla v hlavním městě vnímána jako jakési neuchopitené zlo, jen formou denních zpráv o ztrátách a nářků spousty zmrzačených vojáků žebrajících v ulicích.<N>Po životě stráveném v beztvarém strachu byl pohled na opravdové quaidské město opravdu zvláštní zážitek. Zasáhla mne jeho krása a chytrost staveb, ale více než to, šokovalo mne, jak povědomě pusobí.<N>Všechny ty stopy běžného městského života: ošlapané dlažební kostky, sochy poznamenané vandalismem mnoha mladých generací, stánky na tržišti.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DESERT_FORTRESS_RIGHT_0_00	Není vůbec těžké se představit mého otce, jak sedí na rohu ulice a střídavě se směje a nadává pri vyměňování historek s ostatními staříky.<N>A přesto, lid z tohohle města má na svědomí zničení Terny a pozabíjení obyvatel, všech mužů, žen i dětí.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MARKOS_TITLE							
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MARKOS_LEFT_0_00	Den 18 - [knight_hero]						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MARKOS_LEFT_0_10	Už jsem si tak zvykla na společnost cvoků, že na normálnost jsem přestala věřit.<N>[knight_hero] je vychovaný, inteligentní, dobromyslný, občas i zábavný - sakryš, dokonce i dbá na osobní hygienu - tak jen čekám, kdy a co se provalí.<N>Neco špatného na něm přece musí být! Nějaká úchylka, slabost, něco šáhlého. Jestli jsem se doteď něco naučila, tak je to fakt, že v Jámě prostě nic není normální.<N>Určitě je to ten knírek, že jo? Za tím knírkem schovává všechno cáklé.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_LETTER_MARKOS_1_LEFT_0_10	Pro madam [mcguffin_hero] Livbar, píše <knight_hero_fu> Kashantir, Rytíř Pána Hostitele z Ashe.<N>Madam, se vším respektem k Vaší pozici coby velitele této výpravy, chtěl bych zmínit jisté výhrady ohledně Vaší volby účastníků. Abych byl konkrétní, nedokážu zaručit Vaši bezpečnost, či bezpečnost dalších účastníků výpravy, pokud s námi i nadále bude cestovat <mage_hero_fu> Lan Laxmi.<N>Mužete mě ujišťovat, že “není tak hrozná” a že válka s Quaidy už skončila, ale já ujištuji Vás, že pro ni zcela rozhodně neskončila. Je fanaticky oddaná čemusi, co už neexistuje. Bohužel tu není žádná struktura velení, která by její šílenství zarazila. Pokud <mage_hero_fu> uvěří, že pro slávu Quaidů je nutno nás všechny ve spánku podřezat, nikdo z nás se rána nedožije.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_LETTER_MARKOS_1_RIGHT_0_00	Doporučuji Vám, abyste svoje vazby s ní ukončila co nejdříve a co nejopatrněji.<N>Váš skromný služebník,<N><knight_hero_fu> Kashantir

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_LETTER_MARKOS_2_LEFT_0_10	Drahý <knight_hero_fu>,<N>V odpovědi na Váš dopis bych ráda zmínila tři věci.<N>Zaprvé, proč mi píšete dopis, když by stačilo ujít pár metrů a promluvit se mnou? Je snad něco v nepořádku s mojí osobní hygienou? Dělají si z toho ostatní legraci za mými zády?<N>Zadruhé, už mi konečně přestaňte říkat madam.<N>A zatřetí, [mage_hero] není Vaše starost. Nechte ji na pokoji, nebo... nevím, třeba Vám zapálím kotlety nebo něco...						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_LETTER_MARKOS_2_RIGHT_0_00	P.S. - To s těmi kotletami byla jen legrace, nikdy bych je nezapálila, protože byste bez nich vypadal divně a já bych si pro Vás musela vymyslet jinou tajnou přezdívku - a pan Maxikotleta má prostě šmrnc. Každopádně chci jen říct, že <mage_hero_fu> to neměla zrovna jednoduché.<N>Takže, co kdybyste začal rýpat do někoho, kdo si to zaslouží, jako třeba [berserker_hero_up], který si myslí, že si nevšimnu, že mi čte přes rameno, i když hlučně dýchá ústy a smrdí jak dvě hromady...

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_NIRU_LEFT_0_00	Noc 22 - [dragon_hero]						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_NIRU_LEFT_0_10	O dracích už jsem mockrát slyšela. Moje sestřenka jimi byla celé dětství posedlá a doslova hltala každou knížku o nich, kterou jsem v knihovně našla - od Polimonových vědeckých hypotéz po nomádské bajky. Pak mi ty příběhy vyprávěla tyickým dětským způsobem, pozpátku či napřeskáčku a jedním dechem. I přesto mi v paměti hodně z těch příběhů utkvělo. A teď, když mi společnost dělá opravdový drak z masa a krve, všechno se mi to vrací.<N>Během svého putování jsem se naučila, že většina mých teoretických poznatků se ukazuje velmi nepřesnými v konfrontaci s živoucí realitou. Ale v tomhle případě moje vzdělání kupodivu sedí: [dragon_hero] je tlustá, hamižná, sobecká přerostlá ještěrka, propadlá shromažďování bohatství a iluzím o svém božství.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_NIRU_RIGHT_0_00	Takhle mocné stvoření je velmi nebezpečné. Vůbec by neměla výčitky někoho z mojí skupinky sežrat - zabíjí všechno, co ji byť jen lehce rozčílí - a cokoliv “smrtelné” obecně vnímá jako hluboko pod svou úrovní.<N>Nadřazenost je často nejvyšším stupněm ignorantství. [dragon_hero] má ve svém majetku cenný “nápojový pohár pro draky”. Kdyby nebylo čtení nápisu v ashštině pod její úroveň, věděla by, že ve skutečnosti nejde o nic menšího než “Nočník Lorda Redamala”. Kdykoliv mě její nadřazenost vytočí, vzpomenu si, jak tenhle “pohár” nadšeně používá.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_NIRU_LEFT_1_00	Noc 24 - Přídavek						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_NIRU_LEFT_1_10	Přes svůj zjevný nezájem o cokoliv kromě jí samé, [dragon_hero] je překvapivě starostlivá matka.<N>Když ji vidím, jak se stará o blaho svých potomkú, nemohu si nevzpomenout na svoji vlastní matku. Je to divná asociace, s gigantickým monstrem, které mi skoro denně vyhrožuje, že mě sežere nebo sežehne na uhel.<N>Vím, že přílišné sympatie by mě mohly stát život, ale nedokážu si ani představit, jak moc trpí nad ztrátou svých mladých, které unesli Navrátilci. Zdá se, že tahle obrovská tragédie se dotýká i těch nejmocnějších a nejodtažitějších z nás.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DREAM2_TITLE							
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DREAM2_LEFT_0_00	Den 25 - Druhý sen						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DREAM2_LEFT_0_10	Ten sen se mi tuto noc vrátil. Mělo to jinou formu, ale hned jsem věděla, že je to stejný sen - nebo alespoň já jsem byla stejná.<N>Stála jsem ve velikém sále. Jeho zdi se tyčily do takové výše, že strop tvořily mraky. Zdi byly zlaté a lesklé, zdobené velkými drahokamy, kam až moje oko dohlédlo. V mých rukách byl pohár z jakéhosi vzácného materiálu, temného jako víno a chladivého na dotek. Navzdory všemu bohatství a pokladům, jež mne obklopovaly, cenila jsem si toho poháru nadevše a opatrně jej nosila, aby ani kapka neukápla. Najednou se zatmělo a do haly vtrhla lůza. Udeřili mne a pohár mi vyrvali z rukou. Zařvala jsem, vytáhla z šatů ostrou dýku a bodala jsem a sekala kolem sebe, až celá podlaha byla pokryta krví.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DREAM2_RIGHT_0_00	I přes obrovské ztráty mne ten dav vytlačil do potemnělého předsálí. Bojovala jsem do posledního dechu, ale jejich rány mne nakonec zlomily, padla jsem na zem a ta lůza se přese mne přehnala a jala se trhat drahokamy ze zdí.<N>Dlouho jsem ležela a myslela si, že jsem mrtvá. Když jsem konečně našla sílu se postavit na nohy, bylo tam pusto. Zdi byly stržené a rozbité, vše bylo pokryto špínou a sazemi. Pohár samozřejmě nikde. Chodila jsem sem a tam snad celou věčnost a volala, ale byla jsem sama, pohár mi sebrali.<N>Sedla jsem si na zem a plakala.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_ZELEMIR_DEAD_LEFT_0_00	Den 28 - Zelemirova smrt						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_ZELEMIR_DEAD_LEFT_0_10	Královražda je zvláštní pocit. Vím, že jsem udělala rozumnou věc, ale přesto - prolila jsem ashskou královskou krev. Ale on se tak zvrhl, že ohrožoval samotný řád bytí. Ale ten pocit mne pořád pronásleduje. Byl to první opravdu živý člověk z masa a kostí, kterého jsem zabila.<N>[mage_hero] se zmítá mezi vztekem a nadšením, proklíná jeho jméno, jako by ho mohla zabít znovu. A je to vcelku pochopitelná touha vzhledem k tomu, co nás za poslední týdny potkalo.<N>Co mě nejvíc děsí - všichni ti Navrátilci, co nás pořad pronásledují. Jejich vůdce a stvořitel je mrtev - jak je může jeho vůle dál pohánět vpřed?<N>Ptám se a přitom odpověď znám, ale nechci si ji připustit. Není to jeho vůle. Je to trochu jiné. Vede je teď jiná ruka.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_ZELEMIR_DEAD_RIGHT_0_00	Pocítila jsem to divnou sílu, o které Zelemir mluvil, to zlo vězněné krví obětí. Eztli-Tenoch.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DREAM3_LEFT_0_00	Den 29 - Třetí sen						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DREAM3_LEFT_0_10	Znovu jsem měla sen.<N>Stála jsem na opuštěném místě. Přede mnou se desítky metrů k nebi tyčil obrovský krystal. Plakala jsem, slzy mi stékaly po těle, přes moje šperky a talismany, až na zem. Stékaly v malých potůčcích po zaprášené zemi k tomu krystalu a já si najednou uvědomila, že už to nejsou slzy, ale krev.<N>Kolem mne byla spousta mrtvol - muži, ženy, děti. Moje ruce byly špinavé jejich krví. Otočila jsem se, a za mnou stála armáda, stejně jako já zbrocená krví. Čekali, až promluvím.<N>Zvedla jsem svoje rudé ruce k nebi a hromovým hlasem zařvala.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DREAM3_RIGHT_0_00	Celá armáda ten můj řev zopakovala. Bylo to slovo, které jsem nikdy neslyšela, ale hned jsem věděla, co znamená - krev. Bylo tak hlasité, až se chvěla země.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_THRONE_ROOM_LEFT_0_00	Den 35 - Eztliho trůn						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_THRONE_ROOM_LEFT_0_10	Jak tohle píšu, [berserker_hero] si sedl na trůn jak na hospodskou židli. Na Eztli-Tenochův trůn.<N>Nemám z toho vůbec dobrý pocit - ale proč? Proč by mělo zlo vzbuzovat respekt? Tenhle zlatý muž není nic víc než násilník, který má blízko k tomu, aby se stal bohem. Na tomhle druhu zla je něco patetického - koukají z toho komplexy a pomýlení těch, kteří chtějí být slavní. Podívejte se na mne, křičí, já jsem ztělesněná moc! Eztli-Tenoch, bůh, bezmocný ve své krystalové kleci.<N>Ale něco ve mně tomu rozumí. Něco, co procházelo těmito sály, co znalo božství. Co sedělo po jeho boku a soudilo lůzu. Ucítila jsem to volání božství.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_THRONE_ROOM_RIGHT_0_00	Možná je to ta pachuť, kterou cítím ve svých snech, která tvaruje moje opovržení. Viděla jsem, co on opravdu je, a co si myslí, že je.

Ta moc, ta ztráta, ta pomsta. Prožila jsem, aspoň částečně, všechno, co ji utvořilo. A teď jsem byla svědkem té oběti, která její bytí ukončila.

[mage_hero] má pěnu u huby.<N>Tady je naše záchrana!<N>Ale obě volby jsou nebezpečné: postavit se Zelemirovi, riskuji život svůj a všech ostatních, které by vypuštěný Eztli-Tenoch zahubil. Riskuji osud celého světa! Ale utéct a nechat ho konat, riskuji svoji duši.<N>Kéž bych byla zemřela v Ashi. Dala bych cokoliv za to, abych si z tohoto nemusela vybrat.

Je to vlastně dobře zdůvodněné a promyšlené - práce mistra strategie, která vyřeší hrozivé prokletí.<N>A je to nechutné, odporné..<N>Kdo bojuje proti chaosu zabíjením nevinných, zrazuje sám sebe.<N>Už jednou jsem se mu postavila. A udělám to znovu tolikrát, kolikrát to bude potřeba, abych ty lidi ochránila. A nebo to aspoň zkusím.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_EPILOGUE_TITLE							
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_EPILOGUE_LEFT_0_00	Epilog						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_EPILOGUE_LEFT_0_10	Je to divný pocit, jen tak se zastavit a říct si: “Vůbec nic a nikdo se mne nesnaží zabít.”<N>Pořád tomu nějak nemůžu uvěřit. Pořád čekám, kdy se chodbami knihovny přiřítí vražedné ovce. Zatím to zkusila akorát myš, kterou bezpečně zastavilo Polimonovo Jak fungují rostliny.<N>[knight_hero] se stal pravideným návštěvníkem knihovny. Za poslední měsíc si půjčil všechno s vojenskou tématikou, co jsem dokázala v regálech najít - a když tohle téma vyčerpal, začal hltat další knihy bez ohledu na téma. Myslím, že poslední, co četl, byl návod k rozmnožování fretek, který náhodně vytáhl - a další návštěvu strávil místo čtení povídáním se mnou. Věděla jsem, že s ním něco není v pořádku.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_EPILOGUE_RIGHT_0_00	Ale nestěžuju si, je fajn mít si s kým povídat, když plním police knihami. Během té morové epidemie byla spousta knih použita k topení, knihovna byla úplně zdecimována - police zely prázdnotou.<N>[knight_hero] mi věnoval několik knih, které koupil od nomádských obchodníků - a včera jsem dostala balík s nápisem: “PRO [mcguffin_hero_up], JEJÍŽ PRÁCE JE PĚKNĚ NUDNÁ VE SROVNÁNÍ S MOJÍ, COŽ JE ZABÍJENÍ”<N>Uvnitř bylo několik velmi vzácných textů ze západu, starých asi tři sta let, a pár primitivních malůvek, kde postavička s nápisem “JÁ” bojuje s různými příšerami. Všechno zůstane uchováno pro příští generace v renovovaném východním křídle knihovny, včetně tohoto deníku.<N>Často si říkám, jak se asi vede mým spolubojovníkům.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_EPILOGUE_LEFT_1_00	<N>Jsou to jen dva měsíce, ale vím, že pro takové, jako [berserker_hero] a [ranger_hero], jsou to stovky nových dobrodružství.<N>O tom, co dělá [mage_hero], moc nevím, ale občas se nomádští obchodníci zmiňují o šílené císařovně z ruin - z čehož usuzuji, že dobývání ztraceného území se jí daří.<N>Někdy se o ni bojím - teď, kdyz epidemie skončila a Navrátilci zmizeli, trosky Quaidského císařství jsou lákavým cílem pro všechny aspirující vojevůdce a bandity, nemluvě o severních královstvích. Ale na druhou stranu, jestli někdo dokáže válčit proti zbytku světa a s úsměvem na konci vyhrát, pak je to určitě [mage_hero].<N>[healer_hero] se vrátil do kláštera. Občas mi píše a popisuje, jak se Jáma postupně mění. Obchodníci, cestovatelé i poutníci si tam pomalu nacházejí cestu, i když bude trvat, než se oblast zbaví svého stigmatu úplně.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_EPILOGUE_RIGHT_1_00	Možná bych v příštích měsících mohla přijmout jeho pozvání a navštívít ho. Město se pomalu staví na nohy a s tím přichází hektický shon života - něco, co si ráda odpustím.<N>Moje oči touží obhlížet vzdálené horizonty. Asi je ve mně přeci jen kus dobrodruha. Nepochybuji, že [knight_hero] a jeho stráže by mne doprovodily, takže by to vůbec nebyla nebezpečná cesta - a kdyby se mi zase podařilo ho přemluvit ke zpěvu, byla by i velmi zábavná.<N>Myslím, že [dragon_hero] definitivně opustila svět smrtelníků, ale jistá si nejsem. Minulý tyden se na střeše objevil balíček knih se zlatou vazbou - a vynést takový náklad do takové výšky, to by vyžadovalo velmi zkušeného lezce, takže se přikláním k tomu, že náš tajemný dárce byl obdařen schopností letu. To by znamenalo, že jedna naše bohyně si našla partnera, jenž jí pomáhá s výchovou potomstva.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_EPILOGUE_LEFT_2_00	Je to šťastná představa, tak se jí budu držet.<N>Pomalu si zvykám mluvit s lidmi mimo naši malou skupinku. Těch pár, kterým jsem se začala svěřovat, mi moc nevěří - a nebo to na ně nedělá dojem, protože už byli vystaveni značně přehnaným zkazkám navrativších se uprchlíků.<N>Dneska mne na ulici zastavily dvě děti a prosily mne, abych sežehla obličej někomu, kdo je šikanuje. Zajímavé, vždycky chtějí sežehnout obličej. Odehnala jsem ho jedním zlým pohledem, což možná udělalo větší dojem, než plameny. Už se mi stalo, že po mně někdo chtěl vyléčit vybočené palce na nohou, požehnat oslu, seslat kletbu na otravné sousedy a podobně.<N>Možná proto jsem tak ráda, když se v knihovně objeví [knight_hero].						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_EPILOGUE_RIGHT_2_00	Nikdy nemluvíme o tom, co jsme zažili, ale je tu jakési mlčenlivé souznění či porozumění, které prostě s nikým, kdo s námi nebyl, nezažiju.<N>Často si říkám, uvidíme se někdy všichni pohromadě?<N>-[mcguffin_hero] Yalkie Livbar

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_ACTQUOTES_LEFT_00	Act Intro Quotes						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_ACTQUOTES_LEFT_10	Some of my favorite things to write were the little bits of flavor text that opened each act of the story. They really let me experiment with other voices and give the player little glimpses into the larger world that the story was set in. When it came to start act seven, I actually came up with three different quotes and then picked a favorite to use in the game. Here are the two that didn't make the cut:<N><N><LQ>When faced with a decision, the selfish man thinks on a multitude of outcomes, weighing which option will yield him the best return.  The true man thinks only of which will serve the Flame.<RQ><N>- From the Book of Seven Wisdoms on the Path of the Blade<N><N><LQ>I look at the faces of our Northern mercenaries and I see the despair of a man who has gambled and lost.  We shall all die, but I shall die for my home, for my family, for the King and the Temple.  They shall die for a paltry sum of gold.<RQ><N>- Unknown defender, Siege of Karedon's Pass						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_ACTQUOTES_LEFT_1_00	introductory bit of flavor text was taken from Thief: The Dark Projekt, one of my favorite games of all time. I don't think I've ever played anything else that had such a lavishly imagined, nuanced, and hauntingly beautiful setting. Master thief Garrett silently slipping through the shadows of The City, amidst grinding industrial machines and occult horrors, passing unseen through the warring factions of magic and reason is an image that will stay with me for the rest of my life. Sometimes I cry when I think about it. Although, that may have more to do with all the paint I ate as a kid...						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_ACTQUOTES_RIGHT_0_00	The one that finally made it into the game is this:<N><N><LQ>It is said that men fear death.  In my experience, what men truly fear is the uncertainty of death.  In all that ordeal, when death was the only conceivable outcome, I was possessed by an unassailable calm I have never felt before or since.  It was only when the chance of survival appeared that I felt the true grip of terror.<RQ><N>- from the Memoirs of Gedemon Dalavbar, Master of Archers, being a History of his Adventures and Exploits in Service to the Ash King<N><N>This quote was highly inspired by a passage from Shadow of the Torturer, by Gene Wolfe, which I began reading as I was finishing work on Defender's Quest. (I didn't realize this inspiration until long after I finish writing the piece.) It's an incredibly strange, often disturbing book, which I would not recommend to younger readers. However, for mature audiences who are interested in taking a journey to a new and alien place, the book captures a sense of otherness in its world and values rarely found in modern fiction.<N><N>Speaking of inspirations, the idea of each act having an

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_ASHTEMPLE_LEFT_00	The Temple of Ash						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_ASHTEMPLE_LEFT_10	The Temple of Ash is a monotheistic-based monarchical religious philosophy centered on balance and community. The world is seen as a great machine, functioning under the impetus of the Unmoved Mover, the creator who sets everything in motion. The role of the individual is to serve their purpose as a part of the greater machine, being in balance with their place in the world around them. Evil is seen as the failure to do so, or imbalance. (This place is dictated by social structure – great emphasis is placed on the chain of command or chain of being.) The center of the religion is the physical High Temple, which was once the school of the founding philosopher. Water is a key element in Temple rituals, the hydrological cycle being an example of an element in balance with its purpose in the great machine. After death, those who have fulfilled their purpose within the Earthly Machine are taken by the Unmoved Mover and made part of the Celestial Machine, the perfected version of the earth.<N>The Temple of Ash was founded by Selinadt, an exiled philosopher from one of the distant northern						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_ASHTEMPLE_LEFT_1_00							
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_ASHTEMPLE_RIGHT_0_00	independent city states. Banished from his homeland through the machinations of his political rivals, Selinadt wandered south, offering his services to various local rulers as an advisor. The King of Ash took him in after he defeated the king's wisemen in a riddle competition. After the conversion of the King of Ash, Selinadt's religious philosophy became widely popular throughout the region.<N><N>Since the King of Ash was the very first convert, each of his successors is seen as the caretaker of the Temple. The religion is practiced throughout the smaller neighboring kingdoms, but the High Temple at Ash is its center. For this reason, Ash is understood to be completely neutral in the wars that break out amongst its neighbors. In the few occasions that one of its neighbors has threatened it, the others have joined together against it to defend the Temple. This neutrality has allowed Ash to grow as a robust trading center, increasing its power and influence greatly. With the threat of the Quaid Empire, Ash's smaller neighboring kingdoms have united as a defacto federation, making Ash a sizable, albeit fractured empire.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_BERSERKERS_LEFT_10	Boy, it sure looks cool when a killer swordsman keeps his awesome sword on a scabbard on his back instead of on his side like a normal person! So cool, in fact, that I initially designed the Berserkers to look like this. Fortunately, my sublimated spirit of neurotic historical obsession materialize in front of me, slapped me in the face with a hand clad in 100% authentic riveted mail, and pointed out that keeping your sword on your back is the dumbest thing anyone could ever do ever.<N><N>But Link! And Geralt! And ninjas!<N><N>To which the spirit of neurotic historical obsession says:<N><N>Your back is a great place to keep things if you just want to carry them around. For instance, backpacks.<N><N>However, if you want to be able to draw a weapon you will discover that it is impossible to do so from your back. Go ahead, try it out. It's a Herculean effort to pull						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_BERSERKERS_LEFT_1_00	the coolness of drawing things from your back that they've designed special sheaths that exist only to do this. They're this weird kind of half scabbard sort of thing and they look stupid and they are stupid only stupid people use them and they still won't work as well as drawing it from your side.

Then I spent two hours watching German Longsword Fencing videos on YouTube and weeping for my sins.

(One of the Roman emperors that I'm too lazy to look up at the moment – Hadrian, I think? – actually bragged in one of his writings that London was such a subjugated city his troops could walk through the streets with their weapons on their backs. Because… if there was danger of you getting attacked… you'd want to have your weapons where you could actually reach them.)<N><N>Next time you see some movie where some super cool dude keeps his sword on his back (or better yet, two swords), watch closely when he draws it. You'll notice the film always conveniently cuts – he gets a couple inches out of the scabbard (with the appropriate metal-on-metal shing noise that by the way would only ever happened if something was scratching the crap out of your blade) and then magically it cuts to him with the sword all the way out. This is because the in between part is anatomically impossible – you can't draw anything longer than your arm from your back. At least, not without dislocating something.<N><N>Now, there are some people who are so obsessed with

This spring also wears on the blade, so if you find still extant sabers of this variety, they will oftentimes have significant blade wear where the spring has rubbed against them every single time they're drawn. So yes, that cool shing noise does come from something, however it's very limited, and still bad for the swords long-term. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go flog myself while reading sword and buckler fencing manuals.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_BLOODMAD_LEFT_00	The Blood Mad Tribes						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_BLOODMAD_LEFT_10	The Nomads are actually the scattered remnants of an ancient civilization that was once part of Eztli-Tenoch's domain.  When Eztli-Tenoch was defeated most of them scattered, becoming the tribal, nomadic, polytheistic people that we are familiar with.  But some of them remained loyal to their defeated <LQ>god,<RQ> and, under the leadership of their mysterious Queen, grew into a shamanistic death cult dedicated to freeing Eztli-Tenoch from his prison.  These tribes surrounded the areas around Eztli's prison and set about breaking the blood seal in the only way they knew how: killing anyone they could get their hands on and painting the Great Stone with their blood, hoping that one day, they would manage to nab the right people.  People learned very quickly to avoid these areas, so the Blood Cults spread out, eventually into the territory of the Quaid Empire.  Obviously, having everyone on your highways ritualistically murdered isn't good for business, and certainly not good for the glory of the Cosmic Flame, so the Quaid Empire waged several wars of eradication against the cults (these are the ones that Wrenna refers to).

(Originally, Ozimal was going to get turned into a revenant after Zelemir brutally shanked him to death on screen, but my Tarantino-esque bloodbath was vetoed in favor of some offscreen poisoning. Incidentally, Eyepatch Spear Guy, who has inexplicably attracted a small fan club, was also supposed to die in the melee.)<N>						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_BLOODMAD_RIGHT_0_00	The cults are scattered but still a vague threat.  With the disappearance of their Queen centuries ago, the cults began to lose much of the reasoning behind their actions to complicated ritual. Most blood cults no longer orbit the actual Great Stone, and instead worship and sacrifice to smaller replicas of it.  However, with Eztli Tenoch being somewhat freed from his prison, he has reached out to his long lost children.  The shamans of the blood cults have heard his call, and are all leading their people back into the Pit, back to the Great Stone prison of their god.<N><N>The cultists maintain a poisonous diet (the same poisons Zelemir used on Ozimal) and a crazed mania that they believe to be filled with the spirit of their master. This poisonous diet allows them to transform themselves into revenant as needed. (Eztli-Tenoch's Right Hand is a shaman, or perhaps a group of shamans, that sacrifice themselves to become the hideously twisted instrument of their master's will).<N><N>Ketta's Tribe, the Geka, were massacred by the Blood Cultists when she was in her early tweens, which is why she has few tribal affiliations and why she would

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_BOSSREVENANT_LEFT_10	For those of you who are curious about our boss revenant, here's an explanation from one of our internal design documents:<N><N>Some revenant may be more powerful than others, depending on how much spiritual focus the wizard is giving that particular pawn. Furthermore, some <LQ>shells<RQ> are more conducive than others. For instance, a powerful necromancer could inhabit the corpses of squirrels. And while an army of zombie squirrels would be pretty hilarious, squirrels do not have the same depth of spiritual existence that humans do – less of the their being is in the shadow realm. Basically, the bigger a void left by a soul, the more room there is for the wizard to fill it with his own spiritual focus (ideally as soon as the thing dies – as a corpse rots, so does its spiritual dimensions, so the older a corpse gets, the less it can do). This carries over to people as well. Not everyone has as much room for the wizard to work in. Shallow vessels can only carry a small amount of his spirit, and won't allow him to do things that require more energy						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_BOSSREVENANT_LEFT_1_00							
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_BOSSREVENANT_RIGHT_0_00	than they can hold. On the other hand, some people have significantly more spiritual depth and allow him a lot more room to work in – the newer a corpse is, the more spiritual void is left for him to fill.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_CHIEFTANSTUNIC_LEFT_10	The twisting roots of the World Tree that decorate the Chieftain's Tunic was part of my many efforts to imply a deeper culture and folklore to our various factions, in this case the Nomads.<N><N>A lot of real-world cultures have the concept of a World Tree, but I was inspired specifically by a very strange bit of Greek folklore I read about which involved some Balkan goblins called Kallikantzaroi. The Kallikantzaroi spend the entire year underground, sawing at the roots of the World Tree in hopes of causing it (and therefore the world) to collapse. The Kallikantzaroi are just jackasses like that, I guess. Anyways, the only time they stop trying to kill the world is on Christmas, which arrives just as they are about to saw all the way through the World Tree. Starting on Christmas, they get to come up to the surface and run around peeing in people's beer, stealing candy from babies, sticking your toothbrush in the toilet, and generally being ass-clowns of the highest caliber. All their fun ends on the day of						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_CHIEFTANSTUNIC_LEFT_1_00							
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_CHIEFTANSTUNIC_RIGHT_0_00	Epiphany, when they are banished back down into the earth. They arrive to discover that the joke is in fact on them and the World Tree has healed entirely from all of their sawing. This happens every single year, because the Kallikantzaroi aren't just ass-hats, they're incredibly stupid ass-hats. (I like to imagine that the World Tree went and peed in all of their beer while they were gone.)<N><N>Oh, and if you want to protect your beer, baby-candy, and toothbrushes from the Kallikantzaroi, all you have to do is put a colander out on your porch. Kallikantzaroi can only count as high as the number two – since three, being the number of the Trinity, is a holy number, if one of the Kallikantzaroi says it out loud, they will immediately die. So if you stick a colander on your porch, those punk ass Kallikantzaroi will stay up all night trying to count all of the holes in it but always losing count after the number two. Then you just get up first thing in the morning, bust out your trusty .45, cap those tragically math-obsessed fools in their collective keister, put the bodies down the garbage disposal, and enjoy urine-free beer for the rest of the holiday season. At least, that's how I imagine it going down.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_CUTCHARS_LEFT_10	We were originally going to have an even larger party roster, but had to cut characters in order to keep things at a more manageable size. Among the guys that ended up on the chopping block were the Paladin and the Protector.<N><N>The Protector was going to be a heavily defensive <LQ>tank<RQ> type unit who carried a massive shield. His whole shtick was that he could shield, not just himself, but also nearby allies. So when a defender next to him would have normally gotten hit, the Defender would zap in and block the shot with his shield. Story wise, if I remember correctly, the Protector was going to be part of an elite fanatical military unit from Ash that believed it had a moral obligation to defend any land on which one of its members had shed blood. Elements of the Protector were recycled for Markos the Knight, although the more fanatical <LQ>Our blood! The blood of patriots!<RQ> aspects were left on the cutting room floor.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_CUTCHARS_LEFT_1_00							
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_CUTCHARS_RIGHT_0_00	The Paladin also had a lot of overlap with the Knight, and was similarly axed.

When this class ultimately got cut, I decided the enemy princess character was too good to not use somewhere, and the Ice Mage we all know and love was born.<N><N>While we're on the subject of classes that got changed, the Dragon was originally going to be the Dragon Rider. This absurdly overpowered unit would've been a dragon with an archer riding on its back. As is, Archers are one of the most overpowered classes in the game, so the Dragon Rider was scaled back to a plain old Dragon. I think Niru appreciates it.

The <LQ>realm<RQ> we will be dealing with the most is the <LQ>shadow<RQ> realm, as it is called by the characters. The shadow realm is the dimension of spirit – something like the platonic ideal, but for each object in existence. Every living thing is animated by an invisible force that we only barely experience, but in the shadow realm this spiritual force can be fully experienced and interacted with.

By bringing glory to the Quaid Empire the children earn the right to join their progenitor in the afterlife. The names of Imperial family members who have brought glory to the Empire in some way are recorded on a great stone wall in the Imperial Palace Complex – this functions as something of a ritualistic passport, signifying that they have the right to proceed to the afterlife. Those that have failed to bring glory to the Empire in some way during their lifetime are stricken from all historical records and their body is buried rather than cremated – an incredible dishonor, since cremation is the only way to join the Cosmic Flame.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_MARKOS_NAME_LEFT_10	Markos' name actually comes from a very weird story a good friend of mine was told by one of his professors at St. Andrews. The professor, in his much younger days, had once gone on a tour of Europe. While in France, he visited one of the many medieval cathedrals available to the public. He was so entranced by the structure that he decided it would be a good idea to slip out of his tour group and hide so that, after everyone left and the cathedral closed, he could sneak around and look at everything without some pesky tour guide telling him where he could and couldn't go.<N><N>His plan worked, and as soon as the cathedral and shut down for the day, he slipped out of his hiding spot and began perusing. It was around this point that he noticed a pair of feet poking out from behind a tapestry. As it turned out, he was not the only one with a grand idea of secretly admiring medieval architecture. The person behind the tapestry turned out to be one of the young women from his same tour group, and the two of them began exploring the cathedral together.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_MARKOS_NAME_RIGHT_0_00	The two of them, distracted talking with each other, did not notice the arrival of a third-party until he asked them if they would like a <LQ>secret tour.<RQ> The man, who identified himself as Markos, had wild hair, an untrimmed beard, and long fingernails. He apparently made a regular habit of hiding in cathedrals until they closed and then exploring them at night, and was full of all kinds of behind-the-scenes information, even going so far as an impromptu performance on the church organ. It was around this point that he explained that many medieval Christian cathedrals were actually built on older pagan sites, and that oftentimes these pagan sites still existed below the later structure. This was actually his primary interest in cathedrals, as he was a druid. After some time spent exploring the back of the church, he successfully located an important looking hatch in the floor that opened into the catacomb that ran underneath the cathedral. Apparently seeing nothing wrong with following a strange man into a subterranean death chamber, the two tourists joined Markos underground, where they found the remnants of the pagan tomb that the church had been built on top of.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_NAMES_LANG_LEFT_10	A lot of people have commented on the strange and unusual names the game generates for generic units that the player recruits in towns. These names were part of an effort to play up the differences between the three primary cultures: Ash, Quaid, and Nomad.<N><N>You'll notice that certain names crop up with certain physical characteristics. This is because the game has a list of physical characteristics for each civilization as well as a list of culture-specific names – when the player clicks to recruit a character, the game first randomly picks one of the three cultures for the recruit to come from and then picks a random name and physical characteristics from that culture's lists. For all three of you that are interested in such things, here's our old naming guide:

Having a small population that mostly marries within itself means that unusual genes, such as red hair and green eyes, tend to show up more often. Quaid names - lots of W's and L's, taking inspiration from Welsh and Hawaiian without being obviously one or the other (mostly because I was looking for letters that the Ash names weren't using prominently and L and W seemed to be it.) There's also a dash of Anglo-Saxon influence. Quaid uses the letter C rather than K, and often uses Y as a rounded I. Female names tend to end in -a and often <LQ>-nna.<RQ>

Complicating this was the fact that we had three prominent civilizations that I was already trying to make feel very distinct.<N><N>I ended up going with Nahuatl (Aztec) names, since the language was significantly distanced from the other real-world languages that we were using as inspirations (Greek and Arabic for the Ash, Welsh/Hawaiian/Anglo-Saxon for the Quaid, faux Finnish and Afghan for the Nomads).<N><N>In retrospect, the mixing of real-world names, like Azra and Zelemir, with completely made-up gobbledygook, like Ketta and Bakal, is a little bit strange (although quite true to our JRPG roots, I suppose.)<N><N>It also means that our entire story can be summed up as, to quote Lars, <LQ>one continuous chase scene with an Aztec god buried at the end.<RQ>

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_NOMADSPIRIT_LEFT_00	Nomad Spiritualism						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_NOMADSPIRIT_LEFT_10	Originally, the Nomads practiced a tribal based polytheism. Each tribe has it's own gods (and among many tribes, each individual family has a subset of lesser household demi-gods) represented by idols. These gods are there to serve the tribe's interests, but must also be honored and served in return. Infighting and feuds are very common among the different tribes, as the constantly moving nomads often encroach on one another's turf, or take to rustling or raiding. The tribal gods serve as standards in these fights. For a tribe to lose it's idols is the ultimate disgrace, and (unless the tribe can regain the idols through warfare) generally signals the end of that tribe's existence. A tribe without it's gods is considered the lowest of the low, and shunned from trading and other meetings.<N><N>Each individual Nomad is also given a personal idol at birth, which is believed to be a servant of the tribe's gods. These servant spirits act as the individual’s guide and guardian through life. At a Nomad's death, the personal idol is buried with its owner in order to guarantee safe passage to Paradise. For a Nomad to lose						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_NOMADSPIRIT_LEFT_1_00							
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_NOMADSPIRIT_RIGHT_0_00	their personal idol is a catastrophic event. Without its guardian spirit to lead the way, the Nomad's ghost is doomed to spend many ages looking for the path to Paradise.<N>    Prolonged exposure to the Ash Kingdom through trade, etc. has led to many of the tribes picking up the teachings of the Temple of Ash. Only a handful have been willing to fully abandon the old ways and completely join the Temple of Ash. The majority attempt to reconcile Ash's deity with their own. This muddling of the faith has created a lot of religious animosity from the Temple of Ash, adding to the general prejudice against the Nomads in the Ash Kingdom.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_STORYINSPIRE_LEFT_00	Story Inspirations						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_STORYINSPIRE_LEFT_10	A fellow English major once asked me what the literary inspirations for the story of Valley of the Forgotten were. For the other two of you that would be interested in these things, here's the top three things that were on my mind when I was writing:<N><N>The plague colony concept actually came from one of Rudyard Kipling's short stories, The Strange Ride of Morrowbie Jukes. I read it when I was 11 or 12 and the idea of a naturally shaped prison full of people that had <LQ>died<RQ> but recovered has stuck with me ever since. There's this very strong sense of a plague society that inspired some of the details in the Pit. (For instance, the fact that there are no horses. One of the first things that happens to Morrowbie is that his horse is killed and eaten - although he gets a share of the meat, so it's not all bad.)<N><N>Beyond that, a lot of the cultural flavor came from Byzantine historical records. Much of the Selini culture is based on the writings of the early desert fathers and						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_STORYINSPIRE_LEFT_1_00							
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_STORYINSPIRE_RIGHT_0_00	other early Eastern Christians.<N><N>And just to round out my history lit nerdom, a HUGE inspiration was Anglo-Saxon literature. I had just taken an Old English course when I started working on Defender's Quest and the language and culture were a gigantic inspiration for almost everything. The very pensive, elegiac tone seemed perfect for our kind of Medieval post-apocalypse setting. I highly recommend checking out The Ruin, if you're at all interested in that sort of thing; it's short and really encapsulates the kind of memento mori vibe of Anglo-Saxon literature.<N><N>Of course, there's a ton of stuff beyond that, but those three were probably the biggest influence on the setting. Well, those and a healthy dose of my favorite humor writers.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_WARRIORMONK_LEFT_00	The 9th Branch of the Selini, House Militant, Defenders of Truth and Order						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_WARRIORMONK_LEFT_10	One of the major inspirations for the Ash religion – and especially the Selini like Bakal – was Eastern Christianity. As I was writing, I began to grow worried that the inspiration was a little too obvious. I desperately wanted to avoid cutting and pasting a real world religion wholesale into a fantasy universe, rather than creating a fantasy religion that felt like an organic part of its world.<N><N>I started looking for places where the Ash philosophy would deviate from my inspirations, how values would've evolved unique to this setting, etc. One of the things that immediately sprung out to me was pacifism. Eastern Christianity, while still allowing for some low level of necessary violence, has an incredibly pacifistic vibe. Clergy are banned from killing for any reason – even self-defense. (Self-defense is also frowned at among laymen.) Priests must be able to officiate a						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_WARRIORMONK_LEFT_1_00	monks, a caste-based chain of being governing its social order, a very Deist feeling Unmoved Mover, hydrological rituals, etc., I began to feel confident that the Ash Temple was becoming its own thing, rather than a rehash of real world religions.

(In fact, if a clergyman is involved in an accidental death – say a fatal car accident – he can never serve again.)<N> This seemed like an element that wouldn't necessarily work with the Selini philosophy that I created so far. It would be entirely conceivable, given the Ash religion's focus on order, that violence could actually be seen, at points of absolute necessity, as being a sacred duty. Sometimes, a broken part must be removed before it damages the rest of the machine. Who would be better equipped to carry out this task than warrior Selini? While the Selini would only view violence as a final resort, there would be no taboo against clergy or monks being its dispensers, as the religion I'd created had none of the <LQ>bloodless sacrifice<RQ> at its centerpiece that Eastern Christianity did.<N><N>And that's how we got warrior monks, which didn't even really figure in the game, but hey, they're there in the background.

This attempt at secrecy suggests to me that the armor in question was civilian, rather than military in origin.<N><N>The largest mystery posed by the harness is the damage which, lamentably, renders it unusable by our party. There is a hole, more than a hand's breadth wide, roughly where the wearer's heart would have been

Still holding my wrist, he took his knife and cut open the seam of the gambeson. Inside were a row of sharp needles. He continued cutting down the length of the sleeve to reveal more hidden barbs. All told, there were 32 of them, each tipped with poison, sewn into the outer layer of fabric where one might grab an attacker's arm.<N><N>As [knight_hero] continued his dissection, we discovered a thin pocket, stitched into the sleeve's wrist. Inside was a piece of parchment, rolled on itself. The illustration was not unlike the many illuminated manuscripts I handled back in the great Library of Ash, though foreign in the style. Despite significant damage, the image is still discernible: a slender woman sits on a throne. Her face is obscured by scorch marks, but long white hair runs down her shoulders and mingles with the jewels around her neck. At her feet sit two boys, dark-skinned and golden eyed. The woman rests her hands on the boys' heads. Their hair, like hers, is white.

The barbs, he says, have most certainly sat for so long that their poison no longer holds any potency. He assures me that his intervention was simply to spare me a sore thumb.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_BLACKROBES_LEFT_0_10	[berserker_hero] has begun gathering the bloodsoaked robes of the fallen cultists for some project I prefer to know nothing of. It is strange to see the faces behind the masks, though they be twisted with their sudden transformation into revenant. They are mutilated, many of them, with what I can only assume are self-inflicted wounds. Despite all this, one can still see the men they once were. At one time, they would not have seemed out of place in the company of Nomads.<N><N>[mage_hero] is strangely joyed to have faced them, as if to fight the same enemy as her grandfather is to share in that hero's glory. The cultists, as she explained to me, were once the greatest threat to the Quaid Empire. United under the banner of a central matriarchy, the madmen were a kingdom in their own right, launching full-scale invasions to feed their never-ending appetite for sacrificial victims. Generations of Quaid fought them to a standstill, but it was not until [mage_hero_pos] grandfather that the Empire was able to go on the offensive. His victories were swift and brutal; apparently, after						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_BLACKROBES_LEFT_1_00	[ranger_hero] remains reticent on the subject. Beyond her initial, almost giddy statements, given in the immediate aftermath of the battle, she has said nothing more. Apparently, it is one thing to celebrate a victory, and another entirely to indulge the <LQ>obnoxious curiosity<RQ> of a foreigner. Perhaps my inquisitiveness is thoughtless. When she believes no one looking, I see [ranger_hero] fingering the fox idol around her neck, her eyes flitting nervously amongst the fallen forms of our new enemies.<N><N>That the Geka, and a young [ranger_hero] with them, had some grim dealings with these madmen in the past seems a certainty.<N><N>For once, I feel it is I who have been crass and flippant.

The once powerful institution of matriarch had given way to a disorganized ruling class of high priests, each eager for his own power more than the good of the whole. Without the centralized authority of the <LQ>Queen of Many Devils<RQ> (as the Quaid termed the office), the cultists were unable to provide a unified resistance, and fell under the might of the Quaid offensive.<N><N>Until the coming of the plague years, [mage_hero] and her people had believed the blood-cultists all but exterminated. Now, in this time of chaos, it seems the madmen have returned, fueled by a power new and dark. The timing is no coincidence. Eztli-Tenoch has found his minions, men who willingly sacrifice their humanity for his sake.<N><N>[ranger_hero] called them the <LQ>tribes anathema,<RQ> which, coupled with their appearance, leads me to wonder if these men were not once Nomads such as she.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_BOOKKEEPING_LEFT_0_10	After freeing the last prisoners from Ozimal's pathetic den, I must confess that I derived a shameful amount of enjoyment from raiding the wretch's personal quarters. His few remaining guards had fled at the sight of our victory over their trained revenant, leaving the petty tyrant's chambers ripe for plunder. We procured as much as we could carry from his private larder, acquiring sausages, oil, and a significant quantity of cheeses to help us on our journey. I would have liked to set fire to the rest, but I feared the resultant smoke would betray our position, and hasten the return of the villain and his army. As if sensing my frustration, [berserker_hero] took it upon himself to <LQ>desecrate<RQ> the remaining foodstuffs. He then went on to desecrate the bed, a large section of the floor, and some of the walls. It was not an act one of my station or sex should approve of, but I find it difficult to not grin when I think of the unpleasant discovery awaiting Ozimal on his return.<N><N>[berserker_hero] must imbibe truly astounding quantities of water.

On Ozimal's lecturn, I discovered (just prior to the <LQ>desecration<RQ>) several scraps of parchment which made up the bookkeeping side of his base empire.

We took our meal and retired to the small quarters the hospital has provided us as if nothing had happened at all. Or so it seemed to me at the time. I was awoken strangely during the night. [ranger_hero] stood with her hand over my mouth. <LQ>You were talking,<RQ> she explained, as she backed away to her own palett. I asked her what it was I had spoken in my sleep, but she only shook her head. <LQ>I did not understand,<RQ> she said. Her eyes betrayed a fear I have never seen in her before. After many long moments, when she must have believed I slept again, she began to whisper. I could make out very little of her hushed supplications, but one Nomad phrase lodged itself in my ear. It roughly translates to <LQ>Defend me from those set apart.<RQ><N><N>When the whispering stopped, and I was certain she had returned to sleep, I took out my journal and began to write this entry by the light of the flickering fire.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DREAM4_LEFT_0_10	The dreams, or rather the dream, singular, which stretches through my nights in one continuous narrative, comes to me now with greater frequency and intensity. I almost fear to close my eyes each night; it seems when wrapped in sleep my mind is not my own.<N><N>I stood in a dark and desolate place. The sun had set and would not rise. I wept, beseeching the sky, but in my secret thoughts I knew the sun would never shine again.<N><N>The great assembly of people that stood all about me began wailing and giving offerings, pleading with what they did not understand. They cut themselves and each other and lashed out at their surroundings, as if mindless destruction could call back the light that had left them. In the darkness, their eyes were blind to all but violence. It was just as I had taught them.<N><N>I fled my creation. The cries of the mad faded into the dark horizon.  I ran on in darkness, many

In that moment the nothingness in my heart was the most blissful reprieve – to have the churning, anguished storm of my mind replaced with a void… It was more than I could ever hope for or deserve. To feel nothing was the most joyous fantasy… I embraced oblivion.<N><N>From that embrace there came a bitter joy. I drew my hands back and found they each held a small flame.<N><N>I wept again. What a birthright they had been robbed of, these small lights of mine. They should have been stars.<N><N>I took the two pieces of my heart, the twin boys with golden skin and hair, like mine, the color of starlight.

It surged out into the black, stretching from unseen horizon to unseen horizon and myriad in between.<N><N>I cannot tell you how many ages passed like this – when I think on it, I am amazed that a single night was able to contain what would overflow many lifetimes. I filled the infinity with thoughts of all I had lost and all I had taken – my tears were venom, my mind a worthy victim. The cold of the darkness froze my tears to my body. I ran still, but there was no escape. What I fled was myself.<N><N>Finally, after many long ages I saw – I cannot call it a light, for that would compare it to the light which I had lost. It was simply a lessening of the darkness. But I had spent so long in the deep black, deprived of all sensation save my own grief, that the presence seemed escape. I turned and saw before me a small candle, meager and dim, fluttering in the cold night wind. Still weeping, I came close and watched as it tried to warm me.<N><N>It was not a candle, but a man, small and gray. I watched as he set out the dusty baubles of hiscourtship,

While the various necessities a company such as ours has have been met by the same assortment of merchants and tradesmen found in every settlement of the Pit, the people here feel unsound. They are Quaid, mostly, and carry themselves with such a quiet fervor I find myself secretly cataloging escapes whenever one of their number addresses me.<N><N>[knight_hero], especially, seems agitated.

I had believed myself to be a true and ardent follower of Selinadt (a pride that I see now as itself a grave fault.) But surely, I reasoned, one such as I – steeped in verses from childhood, regular patron of the Temple – could consider herself on the righteous path? Despite this, I secretly held throughout my life the delusion that evil was something purely external. First it was the Quaid, architects of all the pain and misery I ever saw throughout my early life. While I read daily about the evil in my own heart, I secretly told myself that none of it could compare to the evil of the armies of the East, murderers and ravagers, men who had made themselves animals. All around me the lamentation of widows, the weeping of orphans, the cries of crippled veterans, all the keening of the city was made by my selfish mind into words of affirmation.

Seeking to terrify the rest of Ash into submission, they swore that no quarter would be offered to the beleaguered defenders. On that black day when the city fell, we saw that oath to be true. But the enemy was not content with the massacre of the garrison and turned their fury on the populace, disregarding age, youth, and sex in their senseless rage. By the day's end, thirty thousand men, women, and children lay slaughtered. Terna was nothing but ashes, populated by scarcely enough souls to recount the horror of what was done there.<N><N>For this reason is my every tenth prisoner burned alive. Until thirty thousand die by my hand, the immolations shall continue, for the edification of the prisoners and the achievement of true balance. This is my solemn oath by the very gold of the Fountain, and not even the threats of a misguided cleric shall keep me from honoring it.<N><N>– General Keznimon Kalredos

No matter the secret thoughts of my heart, I could point to Ozimal or Zelemir and say <LQ>there is the true evil.<RQ><N><N>The way of Selinadt, in usual circuitous faction, has showed to me the grievous folly of my secret beliefs.

I look at the horror on the page before me and I see the vilest sin. But how easy it would have been to commit. How sweet it would have felt to drink deeply from that secret stream in my heart, to inflict the pain and loss, to feel my soul dance with the dark joy of revenge. I think of [mage_hero] weeping in her tent – my evil, inflicted by my modest means.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_GIBBERISH_LEFT_0_10	[knight_hero] woke me today. We had paused briefly to consume some small scraps of food, and I, weary from the long march, reclined in the cool stone archway we had just passed. Sleep, which has troubled me somewhat of late, came easily for once. My slumber cannot have lasted more than a few moments. Presently I opened my eyes to find [knight_hero] standing in front of me. He informed me that we had to press on, and, as he took the path in front of me, added that I had been speaking gibberish in my sleep.<N><N>Though it may have been mere nonsense to his ears, I felt meaning clinging to the corners of my half-sleeping mind. I drew out my journal and, in a rush that dared not stop and examine lest I should lose my quarry, jotted out what I remembered.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_JOURNEYS_LEFT_0_10	I am growing more skilled at walking and writing simultaneously. There is little else to do as we journey, save listen to the endless prattling of my companions, or think on the terrifying mystery of the enemy that pursues us – two activities from which I would welcome any distraction. Hence, this journal.<N><N>I had never fancied myself a traveler; all of my 23 years were occupied in the capitol and its surrounding locales. My childish wanderlust was sated by the written word.<N><N>In those idle moments of daydream when I did entertain fantasies of travel, I always thought it would be to our Western brethren. How interesting it would be to follow the Temple pilgrims on their homeward journey, men of the mountains, dark as Nomads, and beyond them men darker still, people of the sea, all united by the way of Selinadt. Seven kingdoms bound together by the truth of the Fountain.<N><N>If I sought the fear and excitement of heathen lands, I

There, my eager eyes could journey to the North, into the realm of the Carcassians, who we speak of as a single people, but are so many and varied that Gozal the Elder claimed any three of their city states would feel as different as Ash, Quaid, and Nomad. And beyond them the heathen of the heathens, the fantastical terrors of unknown shores, and the great mountain on which Kezmir inscribed the legend <LQ>Here there live the eaters of the moon.<RQ><N><N>What a dismal comparison my current journey makes, here on the doorstep of Ash, where all things familiar turn grim and terrible.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MANUSCRIPT_LEFT_0_00	Day 11 – A Carcassian Manuscript						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MANUSCRIPT_LEFT_0_10	<N>Cleared of all threat, the river outside of [healer_hero_pos] Chapter House has yielded a great bounty. ([berserker_hero], having finished with the revenant, spent the remainder of the day savagely depopulating the water of all other occupants.) While the resultant feast of broiled fish has most pleasantly filled my belly, it is one of the revenant corpses that fills my mind.<N><N>Of all that vile host we purged from the river, one carcass stood out from the rest. He had once been a herald of no small importance, judging by the quality of his dress, and the strange pattern and cut of his attire leads me to believe he hailed from one of the many Northern city states. While the rest of his accoutrements were far too damp-rotted to be of any use, he bore on his belt a watertight capsule of waxed leather. Inside, I discovered a still legible piece of parchment.<N><N>The contents validate my theory as to the man's origin. The text appears to be written in one of the many						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MANUSCRIPT_LEFT_1_00	leads me to suspect that this Nomad loan may be a proper name, possibly that of the manuscript's author, or perhaps the intended recipient.<N><N>Such is the extent of the discoveries I can make on my own. I may call on the aid of [healer_hero], who I am told holds a not inconsiderable level of ability in several Carcassian tongues.<N><N>ADDENDUM:<N><N>[healer_hero] does indeed possess the skill with which his fellow monks credited him. Despite the obscurity of the dialect, he was able, within only a few moments, to present me with a translation of the text's opening line:<N><N><LQ>Return to me, my beloved,<RQ> Further progress was considerably slower, and the resulting interpretation far from complete, but a strange picture has begun to emerge. The second line, <LQ>And to our children who are weeping,<RQ> indicates that the relationship between the writer and recipient was far deeper than a tawdry love affair.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MANUSCRIPT_RIGHT_0_00	Northern languages with which I am woefully unfamiliar (my own specialization being the speech of Ash, ancient and modern, and the dialects of its surrounding peoples, especially our Western brethren.)<N><N>Perhaps it is some great moral flaw that my mind, surrounded by so much carnage and grief, still rejoices at such puzzles. It is a great comfort to me, even if it is also a great selfishness, to shut out the dark and bloody world which has become my life, and dedicate my energies wholeheartedly to the deciphering of some mysterious manuscript. If I close my eyes, I can almost feel myself back at the Library.<N><N>On my own, I have already been able to tease out several details, despite my ignorance of the language. I see, repeated several times, what appears to be a group of glyphs borrowed from the Nomad (a tongue which, at the risk of sounding boastful of my linguistic prowess, I shall admit to possessing a meager command of). It roughly translates to <LQ>ornamented woman,<RQ> or <LQ>Queen<RQ> (as I have seen it used in some texts), though perhaps <LQ>Woman of Many Symbols<RQ> would be closer to the literal meaning. The arrangement of the text around it						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MANUSCRIPT_RIGHT_1_00	From there, [healer_hero] tells me the language becomes increasingly difficult, and the few words he can understand seem such gibberish that he begins to doubt his accuracy. <LQ>What voice have I to challenge the one you now hear?<RQ> is the only other complete statement [healer_hero] is able to produce. The remainder of the text is a mystery we cannot pierce, save for a word which [healer_hero] says could mean either <LQ>gray<RQ> or <LQ>dust,<RQ> several repetitions of the phrase <LQ>you return to blood,<RQ> and many uses of the proper name I discovered previously.<N><N>Hearing me say the name out loud, [ranger_hero] has corrected my understanding of the Nomad loan. In the Northeast (where it seems this manuscript originates), the word for <LQ>symbol<RQ> has somewhat different connotations. According to [ranger_hero], a more accurate translation of the phrase would be <LQ>Woman of Many Mystic Charms.<RQ> The magical quality of the woman has, sadly, not granted me any new insights into the text. All I can say is that she had, at the very least, bewitched the author's heart. Judging by the wealth apparent in his messenger, this Carcassian King (as I would guess) spared no expense in

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MARKOSSTORY_LEFT_0_10	To Lady [mcguffin_hero] Livbar from [knight_hero] Kashantir, Knight of the Host of Ash.<N><N>You asked me, some time ago, how it was I anticipated the danger hidden within the strange armor you discovered. As you correctly guessed, I do have a previous experience with an assassin similarly outfitted. While I rebuffed your curiosity at the time, I have had some days to think on the matter, and have decided to relate to you my experience.<N><N>This is not a story I divulge frequently, nor, if I can help it, think on.<N><N>It was a grim time. The plague would not come for another two years. In those days, it seemed, nothing could stop the Quaid war machine. The Eastern provinces were stained red with the blood of their people, and incursions had begun to break into even the heart of Ash.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MARKOSSTORY_LEFT_1_00	He found a single man.<N><N>I had heard stories of such Carcassians, assassins bred from centuries of war between the Northern city states, men who valued murder itself more than the gold they were paid to commit it. I had always dismissed them as mere soldier's tales.<N><N>Looking at the man, I began to wonder if I had not misjudged.<N><N>He had no hair, as far as I could see, not on his face, nor his brow, nor his pate, nor the backs of his hands. I had never seen any living thing so still. He did not speak, but occasionally, and with no provocation, he would laugh, and when he did the teeth that showed were all midnight black. The men called him the Shade Drinker.<N><N>Our orders were simple: deliver the Carcassian to the enemy camp, and provide whatever assistance he might require in his task.<N><N>The weather was against us. A thick fog had descended during the night, and in the predawn darkness we

Its guard was already dead.<N><N>Still holding my arm, the Carcassian entered the general's tent, drawing me after him. The general lay on a cot at the far end, surrounded by maps and scrolls and other accoutrements of command. Even lying down, I could tell he was a giant of a man, head and shoulders taller than I, and larger still than the slender Carcassian. Releasing me, the Shade Drinker crept to the general's foot. From some unseen sheath, he produced a small knife. He held it over his head for a moment, and it seemed to me time hung still. With a sudden jerk, he brought the knife down into the sleeping Quaidman.<N><N>The general sprang to his feet with a gasp. The knife still protruding from his ribs, he seized the Carcassian by the shoulders and hurled the smaller man across the tent. Drawing his sword from where it lay next to his cot, the Quaidman closed the distance between them with a single step. Fearing for my companion's life, I drew my sword and made ready to strike the advancing giant. My blow was checked by the strange sound of the Carcassian's laughter.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MARKOSSTORY_LEFT_3_00	over in the mist and darkness, and I could hear him scratching something. Then, with a smile almost paternal, he handed me his knife. In the worn leather of the grip were carved strange characters. I looked up, and he was flanked by another four figures, clad and black-toothed smiling as he was. As one, they stepped backwards, into the mist and out of view.<N><N>Our commander choked to death in his sleep several weeks later, and the story spread throughout all the men that it was the Shade Drinker come back for his payment.<N><N>Years later, I met another soldier educated in some of the languages of the Carcassians. I showed him the knife, and he translated the characters for me. They said <LQ>Many lives to you, boy.<RQ>						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MARKOSSTORY_RIGHT_0_00	My father was dead. My brothers were dead. I came forward, the eldest living male of the house of Kashantir, to fight. There were many like me, boys of noble birth who had spent their whole lives training but never yet spilled mansblood. Below us were boys younger still: commoners, peddlers, farmer's sons fresh from the fields, all summoned to give their lives for Ash.<N><N>It was a sign of the kingdom's desperation, I suppose, that such a delicate task was given to us.<N><N>Spies had brought news of a Quaid general making camp with his advance party, the foremost point of the fire worshipers' claw sunk into the heart of Ash. His guards were few, the spies said, the time to strike was now.<N><N>Our commander was ill prepared for such an action. The bulk of his troops were untested recruits, my age or younger, and his Nomad auxiliaries were deserting at a steady pace. He had no reserves, no veterans to call on, and scarcely enough gold to field more than a handful of mercenaries.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MARKOSSTORY_RIGHT_1_00	quickly lost our way. Unwilling to call out, lest we betray ourselves to the enemy, our small number was quickly separated. With rising dread, I realized I was alone in the mist.<N><N>I wandered for a great time, stumbling in my blindness, terrified that every step would discover me to the enemy. Presently I came upon a form in the mist. He was a Quaid guard, dead, red with his own blood. He had no eyelids.<N><N>I had stumbled into the enemy camp, and I was not alone.<N><N>Ahead of me, crouched between two tents, was another figure. I could not make out the man's features, but I reasoned by his stance that he too was an intruder. Creeping to the man's location, I reached out to touch his shoulder and alert him of my presence. Without turning, he caught my arm.<N><N>Cracking a black-toothed grin so wide it seemed to split his face in half, the Shade Drinker pointed at the tent in						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MARKOSSTORY_RIGHT_2_00	He lay, sprawled where the general had tossed him, black teeth shining in grotesque mirth. The giant's demeanor changed. His sword fell from his trembling hands. Like a crumbling tower, he collapsed, his great body wracked by convulsions.<N><N>With a wordless cry, the Carcassian was on him, straddling the dying man as he pried out his knife. I watched in the fear as the assassin reached out both his hands and began to make ablutions with the Quaidman's last ragged breaths, scooping them up and over his head and pouring them out as if they were water.<N><N>As the general's wheezing turned to silence, the Carcassian ended his ritual. He turned and saw me where I stood, still holding my undelivered blow. He made another black-toothed grin at me and peeled back the cloth on his shoulder to reveal a row of barbs, loaded with the venom that had taken his victim's life.<N><N>Taking my wrist again, he led me out of the tent, to the edge of the camp.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_THE_FOX_LEFT_0_10	When I was a child, I once found a dying fox in the gardens that surrounded the Royal Library. How this wild creature had reached the heart of the city is a mystery to me, but his presence had caused the silent patrons to forsake their meditations and attack the small beast with stones and fallen branches, their anger turning the gardens around them into an armory. Broken and bloodied, the fox had dragged himself into an alcove to die. I could hear his small whimpering breaths from the path where I walked with my mother. I darted away and slipped into the doorway of the alcove. The fox froze at my appearance. The whimpering stopped in his red mouth. He met me with a silence containing more pain and anger than any warning growl ever could. His eyes stayed locked with mine as my mother pulled me back to the path and out of view.<N><N>I am reminded of that moment as I sit here waiting in vain for sleep to take me. I braced myself for a violent tempest, but [mage_hero] has walked these ruined halls the whole day long in dispassion, seemingly unaffected by the signs of death all around her.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_THE_FOX_LEFT_2_20	THE MISSING WORDS ARE BECAUSE I FLEXED AND THE FABRIC OF REALITY TORE.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_THE_FOX_RIGHT_0_00	I kept waiting for the storm to break, but when it did, it was not at all in the manner anticipated.<N><N>As I searched the halls and tunnels of this ruin for any clues to our whereabouts, I stumbled across a small scrap of parchment, covered in the burns and stains of violence. A full half of the text had been destroyed – as if the horror of the battle were so fierce even words could not escape. What remained appeared an elegant but hastily written Quaid. I presented it to [healer_hero], but he pronounced that the remaining script had no pertinence to our quest. He seemed eager to remove it from his gaze.<N><N>I do not know why I did what I did.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_THE_FOX_RIGHT_0_10	My dream has left me unsure of my own motivations.						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_THE_FOX_RIGHT_0_20	I would like to say that I spoke to her out of a desire for friendship, or even simply idle curiosity, but I fear my actions were born of a hunger to hurt the only available target for all of my fear and hate. All my life the Quaid have been the invisible source of all anguish. Perhaps I merely wanted to see one suffer the pain of loss they so frequently inflicted upon us. Perhaps her calmness irritated me. Or perhaps I envied her strength and

His eloquence in the face of his death – indeed the death of everything he knew – left me without words. As I stood pondering the ruined elegy, I was shocked to find the bottom of the page stained with tears.<N><N>I opened the flap to [mage_hero_pos] tent but stopped before I could say anything. She was curled in the far end, her flaxen hair hanging in limp strands over her face. Her fox eyes, incarnadined with sorrows I can never know, met mine. It was the same silence as all those years ago, heavy with more pain and anger than any words could ever hold.<N><N>I left immediately, but the image still haunts me. This time, I threw the stones.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_WRENNASTORY_LEFT_0_00	Day 26 – [mage_hero_pos] Story						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_WRENNASTORY_LEFT_0_10	I continue to discover great chasms between the world around me, as it stands in actuality, and the carved and colored interpretation of it that sits in my mind. It seems I have spent most of my life judging, not things themselves, but the intellectual fabrications I have created of them.<N><N>As we sat around the campfire tonight, [mage_hero] began to tell a story. I braced myself, expecting a journey into the grim and macabre: casual killings at a young age, or the violent fervor of the zealot.<N><N>Instead, she told a story about her youngest sister.<N><N>This child, seven years [mage_hero_pos] junior, envied the older girl's mobility. So great was this feeling of inadequacy that she took to – at unexpected moments – clambering onto [mage_hero_pos] back, and so parasitically assuming the height and athleticism she coveted. [mage_hero] soon became adept at removing this unwanted passenger, to the young girl's great frustration. This						
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_WRENNASTORY_RIGHT_0_00	continued for some time, with the youngest repeatedly attaching herself to the oldest, only to be immediately unseated. One day [mage_hero] woke to find her sister perched at the head of her bed, laboriously covering herself with the contents of a pilfered jar of honey, hoping, with this makeshift adhesive in place, to permanently bond herself to her chosen beast of burden.<N><N>[mage_hero] ended the story and looked at me with an expectant, girlish grin. It was some moments before I realized she was waiting for my laughter.<N><N>What a strange and new reaction it was for me. The [mage_hero] of my mind elicited only fear or pity. Her portrait was either that of a grim and terrible warlord, even in her personable moments expressing a humor drenched in blood, voiced with the laughter of the fanatic, or else the pained and broken child, a helpless object on which to pour out all my self-righteous pity.<N><N>How grave my misconceptions are, which seek to condense the human soul to a simple object, pertinent only in its relation to me.
