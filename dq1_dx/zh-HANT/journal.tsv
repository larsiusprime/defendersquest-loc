$ENTRY_JOURNAL_INTRO_TITLE
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_INTRO_LEFT_00	Day 1 - Where am I?
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_INTRO_LEFT_10	I’m probably mad, but nonetheless I shall attempt to record the events that are unfolding before my eyes. The reader may draw what conclusions they will; I report only the happenings as understood by my fevered mind.<N><N>I know for certain that I contracted the plague that ravages our fair capital. I know also that I, like the other victims before me, was taken out of the city and cast into the Pit. From there has followed such a strange and terrifying series of events that I still wonder whether I wake or dream.<N><N>When the fever took me, I found myself in a dark place. Before me stood another victim.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_INTRO_RIGHT_00	There appeared a glorious throne and seated on it a man such as I have never seen before. He was every bit of him golden. I thought at first he must have been a statue, but presently he uttered a word of command. His voice too was golden and the edges of it crackled with the power of thunder. It was no language I had ever heard or read in all the great library of Ash, but my body leapt to its command. My veins strained as if the blood would burst from my body and rush to join him. My heart races just to think of it.<N><N>-[mcguffin_hero] Livbar
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_TITLE
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_LEFT_0_00	Night 1 - [berserker_hero]
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_LEFT_0_10	When I come to write about [berserker_hero], I find I must leave behind the austere language of the capital and adopt a vernacular more fitting the subject.<N><N>[berserker_hero] is a dumbass. He is an ass who is also dumb.<N><N>What he lacks in intellect, he makes up for in smell. If two burning dungheaps could mate and sire offspring, their putrid progeny would quail at the stench that emanates from [berserker_hero]’s uncovered armpits. Indeed, the animate corpses that stalk us are each an exquisite perfume by comparison.<N><N>But [berserker_hero] is more than just a pretty face. He also possess a most winning personality I can only describe as <LQ>pants-on-head insane.<RQ><N><N>Yesterday he argued for fifteen minutes with a rock he stubbed his toe on. And he lost.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_RIGHT_0_00	Truly, I am blessed to travel in such company.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_RIGHT_0_10	Day 3 - Addendum
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_RIGHT_0_20	In the interest of fairness, I must admit that he is also the bravest man I have ever seen. His whole body is a web of battle-scars, though I am somewhat less impressed when I remember that he refuses to wear any sort of clothing or armor on his torso. I suppose the bottom line is this - he is both an intolerable buffoon and a shockingly competent warrior, and I am begrudgingly happy to have him with me.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_RIGHT_0_30	AWWW I LOVE YOU TOO! XOXOXO<N><N><N><N><N><N><N>I DO NOT SLEEP I MERELY FLEX LAYING DOWN IT WORKS MY GLUTES
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_RIGHT_0_40	Also, apparently he can read and write! Where on Earth did this blood-thirsty drifter get an education?<N><N>P.S. If you ever steal my journal again, I will brain you in your sleep.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_LEFT_1_00	Night 3 - second addendum
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_LEFT_1_10	Ok, for the record, [berserker_hero] sleeps naked. All attempts at revenge will take place during the day from now on.<N><N>And no, the scars don’t stop at the waistline.<N><N><N><N><N>I hate you.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_LEFT_1_20	WHAT YOU THINK KHAN AND CHARISSA WOULDN'T FIGHT TOO?
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_PRISON_TITLE
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_PRISON_LEFT_0_00	Day 3 - Prison
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_PRISON_LEFT_0_10	Three days ago I had thought this Pit a prison.  Now I find that even in hell there is always worse.<N><N>The man holding us is named Ozimal Kaz.  He is a cruel, petty, loathsome human being.  How a fellow countryman could become so irredeemably warped is beyond my comprehension.  I would expect this from the Quaid, who have spent the last two decades refining their cruelty on the eastern provinces.  Even the most ruthless of Nomad chieftains  would temper his blood-rage more than this degenerate.<N><N>And from the capitol, by his accent!  This monster grew up in the shadow of the Temple itself!
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_PRISON_RIGHT_0_00	I sit here with his other captives, taken indiscriminately: bandits and brigands, men, women, children, Ash, Nomad, Quaid, all awaiting death at the hands of this man.  Day and night we hear the continuous groans of his kept Revenant, a deafening cacophony punctuated only by the dying screams of the latest victim.<N><N>And here I am, incapable of anything!  If I were only in the coliseum with these hapless victims they would at least stand a fighting chance.  For all his bravado, Ozimal seems hesitant to <LQ>execute<RQ> me a second time.  Perhaps Ozimal fears to lose too many of his kept Revenant - they cannot be easy to capture or maintain, and his petty empire seems to require them to keep his vassals in check.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_PRISON_LEFT_1_00	The words of my mysterious helper echo constantly in my mind.  Ozimal wishes to demonstrate my skills to a <LQ>Man in Red.<RQ>  Who is this Man in Red?  And who is this mysterious stranger so intent on saving me?  Why am I of any importance?  In this torrent of questions I am certain of one thing: I have so far only engaged in violence against those already dead, but if I ever get my hands on Ozimal, this policy will be subject to change.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_HALFWAY_WORLD_TITLE
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_HALFWAY_WORLD_LEFT_0_00	Day 4 - The Half-way World
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_HALFWAY_WORLD_LEFT_0_10	<LQ>Half-way world<RQ> is the best my feeble words can do to describe the place I find myself in - and draw others to.<N><N>Once, when I was very young, I nearly drowned swimming in the shallows of the Kevel.  It is the only experience I can draw any parallels to.  There is the same panic, the same breathless agony as my heart tries to tear itself out of my chest.  But this time father’s hand will not drag me to safety.  There is no shore to cling to, only the moment of death stretching for an eternity.<N><N>The mechanics of how I arrive in this place are beyond my understanding.  All I know is that I go there when I need to be.  Once there I can feel out my fellows, not with any sight, but in the same way that I am aware of my limbs without looking at them.  I merely know that they are there and call on them with the strength that I have.  This strength is little, and I exercise these powers with the feebleness of an infant moving his body, but it is enough to save my life.  As much as I loathe journeying into this terrifying half-way world, it is certainly better than the fate I would face without it.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_HALFWAY_WORLD_RIGHT_0_00
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_AN_EDUCATION_TITLE
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_AN_EDUCATION_LEFT_0_00	Day 4 - An Education
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_AN_EDUCATION_LEFT_0_10	Today, as my mind still swirled with the giddiness of our last victory, my eye was caught by a piece of parchment on the ground. Eager to replenish my own painfully finite supply, I snatched up the abandoned page. I was immediately shocked by its quality. While its edges and creases showed the wear of its journey into the Pit, its thickness and spotless, creamy tone betrayed the wealth from which it originated. This was no pay-scribe's scratch sheet.<N><N>It was at this point that I saw the seal of the Lord Regent. Hungrily, my eyes raced to the opening line:
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_AN_EDUCATION_LEFT_0_20	<LQ>You errant and vagabond wretch scarcely worthy of being called my son,<RQ>
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_AN_EDUCATION_LEFT_0_30	Filled with what Zenimon the Wise termed the <LQ>joy of others' woe,<RQ> I read on with shameful curiosity:
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_AN_EDUCATION_LEFT_0_40	<LQ>Words cannot express my rage. Vashtal reports to me that, on arriving in the land of the Carcassians, he
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_AN_EDUCATION_RIGHT_0_00	discovered you were not in attendance at University, as I had ordered both for your betterment and safety, but rather found an unwashed Nomad heathen masquerading under your name, and studying in your stead. This foul barbarian disclosed that he had been paid a not insignificant sum of gold to receive your education for you, whilst you, no doubt, gallivanted off into the wilderness in search of – <RQ>
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_AN_EDUCATION_RIGHT_0_10	The rest of the text is a mystery to me, for, just at the point that the narrative was waxing especially interesting, [berserker_hero] tore the page from my hand, wadded it into a ball, and ate it while screaming <LQ>It tastes like lies! Lies and dead sheep! But mostly lies!<RQ> directly into my face. His breath leaves much to be desired.<N><N>He then threw a rock at [ranger_hero], and the two launched into a slap-fight lasting half an hour.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_BOOKKEEPING_TITLE
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_BOOKKEEPING_LEFT_0_00	Day 5 - Bookkeeping
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_BOOKKEEPING_LEFT_0_10	After freeing the last prisoners from Ozimal's pathetic den, I must confess that I derived a shameful amount of enjoyment from raiding the wretch's personal quarters. His few remaining guards had fled at the sight of our victory over their trained revenant, leaving the petty tyrant's chambers ripe for plunder. We procured as much as we could carry from his private larder, acquiring sausages, oil, and a significant quantity of cheeses to help us on our journey. I would have liked to set fire to the rest, but I feared the resultant smoke would betray our position, and hasten the return of the villain and his army. As if sensing my frustration, [berserker_hero] took it upon himself to <LQ>desecrate<RQ> the remaining foodstuffs. He then went on to desecrate the bed, a large section of the floor, and some of the walls. It was not an act one of my station or sex should approve of, but I find it difficult to not grin when I think of the unpleasant discovery awaiting Ozimal on his return.<N><N>[berserker_hero] must imbibe truly astounding quantities of water.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_BOOKKEEPING_RIGHT_0_00	Sadly, I find my mirth short-lived. On Ozimal's lecturn, I discovered (just prior to the <LQ>desecration<RQ>) several scraps of parchment which made up the bookkeeping side of his base empire. Going over them now, I see laid out, in most matter-of-fact fashion, the figures of tributes levied, punishments doled out, slaves taken – he writes about human lives as if they were nothing more than smoked hams to line his larder and he a busy merchant.<N><N>One manuscript, in particular, preys upon my mind.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_BOOKKEEPING_RIGHT_0_10	<LQ>To be procured:<N><N>For the Red Collector – survivors of unusual appearance or ability.<N><N>For the Quaidman – young woman, Quaid, blonde hair, facial scars, possibly with the Selini. Desired dead. Proof required.<N><N>For the Man-Seller – Nomad girls, pretty. Higher price for young.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_BOOKKEEPING_LEFT_1_00	For Ash contact – proof of Lord Warden's demise.<N><N>For University Philosopher – preserved flesh of infected, skull talismans, related charms.<N><N>For the Black Robes – Ashani survivors, fresh entries preferred.<N><N>For the Carcassian – boy, nomad appearance, white hair, possibly traveling in the company of one identical to himself. Desired dead. Proof required.<RQ>
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_BOOKKEEPING_LEFT_1_10	To see my own fate, which at the time seemed fantastic in its horror, a single item in a list of planned villainies is a sobering experience. I had thought myself a grand exception in my misery. Now I find such things are merely the daily operations of Ozimal's vile enterprise.<N><N>I find most melancholy of all the thought that many of these crimes were to be perpetrated at the behest of parties outside of the Pit. What can this miserable place possibly have to offer the outside world?
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_BOOKKEEPING_RIGHT_1_00	It is a grim time indeed, when men search hell for fresh evils.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_KETTA_TITLE
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_KETTA_LEFT_0_00	Day 5 - [ranger_hero]
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_KETTA_LEFT_0_10	I think that the thing I like the most about [ranger_hero] is that she smells like goats.<N><N>I mean, it's a hard choice with all the other winning traits like rampant immaturity, constant belittling comments, dim-witted sarcasm, a penchant for petty theft, and horrific eating habits, but when you share a tent with someone, it's the pungent scent of goats that stands above the rest.<N><N>Some nights a cross-breeze whistles through the men's side of the camp, bearing on its airy arms the unmistakable smell of [berserker_hero]. The resulting medley of aromas can only be described as ambrosial. It is on these nights that I actually get the best sleep, as my body seems to choose unconsciousness over attempting to comprehend the aromatic stimuli confronting its senses.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_KETTA_RIGHT_0_00	Day 8 - Addendum
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_KETTA_RIGHT_0_10	Last night [ranger_hero] woke me yelling in Nomad. At first, I thought perhaps she was dreaming of the destruction we so recently witnessed (images which continue to haunt my own waking mind). However, as I summoned up my meager command of the nomad language, I realized that the cry roughly translated to <LQ>Woman of questionable moral quality, he is mine!<RQ> Having delivered this somewhat confusing message, she then ripped out a handful of my hair, stuffed it under her pillow and promptly fell asleep again.<N><N>[ranger_hero] has been uncharacteristically apologetic, even going so far as to show me how to braid horse-hair into my own to mask the bald spot. She claims that she has no idea what dream prompted the outburst. I remain unconvinced.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_AZRA_BY_SLAK_TITLE
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_AZRA_BY_SLAK_LEFT_0_00	Day 10 - [mcguffin_hero] sucks!
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_AZRA_BY_SLAK_LEFT_0_10	SO YOU THINK THAT JUST BECUASE I CANT READ YOUR FANCY-ASS LANGUAGE MEANS I WONT FIND OUT WHAT YOUVE BEEN WRITING ABOUT ME?<N><N>WELL GUESS WHAT, PRINCESS? WE'RE GOING TO WRITE A JOURNAL ENTRY ON YOU!<N><N>WHAT SHOULD I SAY ABOUT [mcguffin_hero_up]? THAT HER FACE IS SO THIN THAT SHE LOOKS LIKE A FISH? ALSO HER NECK IS SO SO SO TOO LONG FOR HER BODY.<N><N>AND HER EARS LOOK LIKE WITHERED APRICOTS. AND HER HAIR IS STUPID AND STRINGY. AND HER PERSONAL HYGIENE IS NOWHERE NEAR AS PERFECT AS SHE BELIEVES.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_AZRA_BY_SLAK_RIGHT_0_00	HOWS IT FEEL, SUCKER? NOW I GUESS I KNOW WHO MY REAL FRIENDS ARE.<N><N><N><N>SINCERELY,<N><N>[ranger_hero_up] WHO LIKES TO EAT POOP HEY [berserker_hero_up] WHY IS MY NAME TAKING SO LONG TO WRITE?
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_KARSK_BURNED_TITLE
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_KARSK_BURNED_LEFT_0_00	Night 7 - The Burning of Karsk
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_KARSK_BURNED_LEFT_0_10	I have been no stranger to death. The last nine months of plague in the capitol have stripped away whatever childish ignorance my privileged position had afforded me on the subject. But I have never before seen such violent destruction. Even the corpse fires outside the Temple Gates pale in comparison. <N><N>I have no words.<N><N>I understand now something of our enemy's nature.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_LAKSOS_TITLE
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_LAKSOS_LEFT_0_00	Day 8 - Laksos
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_LAKSOS_LEFT_0_10	We witnessed a strange Nomad ritual while at Laksos. A new child had been born to the chief of the Karada, a small but still functional tribe. The parents presented the child before two large wooden idols. <N><N>The chief produced a small block of wood which he laid on the head of each idol and then on the head of the child. He then took out a small knife and carved the block, allowing the shavings to fall over the infant's face. Having finished his work, he strung the carving on an animal sinew and placed it around the child's neck. <N><N>There was a great cry and all at once the tribesmen in attendance began dancing and chanting and celebrating in typical raucus nomad fashion. I never saw what it was that the chief had carved.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_LAKSOS_RIGHT_0_00	I later asked [ranger_hero] what this ritual meant and she produced a small wooden fox from around her neck. She said her spirit was the servant of her tribal gods, given at birth as a guardian and guide and to be buried with her at death to guarantee safe passage into Paradise. Just as the tribal gods were given out by the Creator at the time of the tribe's genesis, so the personal spirits were given out to each member of the tribe at their birth. <N><N>I asked [ranger_hero] if losing a personal idol was as catastrophic for the individual as losing tribal idols is for the tribe. She smiled and showed me seven idols she had taken from enemies, explaining that now their souls would spend many ages struggling to find paradise on their own. I asked if it bothered her to have done this to her fellow nomads and she gave me a glassy look, asked if it bothered me that my ears were way too big for my face and then walked off singing about eating goats' tongues. Some day I am going to hit her in the head with a rock.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_JOURNEYS_TITLE
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_JOURNEYS_LEFT_0_00	Day 9 - Journeys
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_JOURNEYS_LEFT_0_10	I am growing more skilled at walking and writing simultaneously. There is little else to do as we journey, save listen to the endless prattling of my companions, or think on the terrifying mystery of the enemy that pursues us – two activities from which I would welcome any distraction. Hence, this journal.<N><N>I had never fancied myself a traveler; all of my 23 years were occupied in the capitol and its surrounding locales. My childish wanderlust was sated by the written word.<N><N>In those idle moments of daydream when I did entertain fantasies of travel, I always thought it would be to our Western brethren. How interesting it would be to follow the Temple pilgrims on their homeward journey, men of the mountains, dark as Nomads, and beyond them men darker still, people of the sea, all united by the way of Selinadt. Seven kingdoms bound together by the truth of the Fountain.<N><N>If I sought the fear and excitement of heathen lands, I
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_JOURNEYS_RIGHT_0_00	needed only to look at the great map of Kezmir Zentbar's travels that hung across the library's north wall. There, my eager eyes could journey to the North, into the realm of the Carcassians, who we speak of as a single people, but are so many and varied that Gozal the Elder claimed any three of their city states would feel as different as Ash, Quaid, and Nomad. And beyond them the heathen of the heathens, the fantastical terrors of unknown shores, and the great mountain on which Kezmir inscribed the legend <LQ>Here there live the eaters of the moon.<RQ><N><N>What a dismal comparison my current journey makes, here on the doorstep of Ash, where all things familiar turn grim and terrible.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_OZIMAL_DEAD_TITLE
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_OZIMAL_DEAD_LEFT_0_00	Day 10 - Ozimal's Death
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_OZIMAL_DEAD_LEFT_0_10	I thought I would gain some small satisfaction with Ozimal's death.  I haven't.<N><N>He was merely one more glassy eyed shambling corpse bent to our enemy's will, a pawn even before his death.  The earth is rid of a wicked, cruel man.  Here in the Pit, will it even be noticed?
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MONASTERY_TITLE
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MONASTERY_LEFT_0_00	Night 10 - The Monastery
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MONASTERY_LEFT_0_10	I suppose it was foolish of me to expect anything in the Pit to resemble home, but I was still shocked to see the Selini monastery here.  It is an imposing, ominous structure, more fortress than temple.  I understand the necessity of these precautions, but it is difficult to reconcile with the Temple Fountain I grew up with, where even the guards carry blunt weapons lest they sow chaos and destruction in the birthplace of harmony.<N><N>What a reassuring thing it was to dip my hands into the Fountain, knowing that I stood in the same place as every believer before me, all the way back to Selinadt himself.  Here I was a humble servant, separated from kings and prophets by nothing more than time.<N><N><LQ>Just as water rises as mist over the valley, falls as snow on the mountains, rushes in rivers down to the sea, so each man, born of the same essence, must serve
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MONASTERY_RIGHT_0_00	the different roles of his time and station and so achieve harmony within the Celestial Machine.<RQ><N><N>I wonder now what role I am to play in this lawless and terrible place, where harmony and wisdom seem far away fantasies.<N><N>There is some comfort, I suppose, in this fortress temple.  Are not these monks serving their purpose?  These imposing walls and warlike defenses are nothing more than the adaptations that allow the spirit of Selinadt to be served here in this lawless place.<N><N>As the great man said himself, <LQ>The truth remains the truth, be it written in any language.<RQ>  These defenses are nothing more than the language of the Pit; the truth inside remains true.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_BAKAL_TITLE
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_BAKAL_LEFT_0_00	Day 11 - Elder [healer_hero]
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_BAKAL_LEFT_0_10	Reverend Elder [healer_hero] is an oasis of sanity in this den of chaos.  Though the speed of our flight leaves little time for conversation, the few fleeting words I can exchange with him have helped my spirits greatly.<N><N>I wish I could offer him the same.  There is some internal anguish tormenting him.  I can see it now and again broiling beneath his placid monk's face.  It is very obvious that he was once a soldier: the scars, the bearing and mannerisms all point to a warrior's life.  <N><N>I discovered at the monastery that he is not actually of the priesthood, though all that know him call him Reverend Elder anyways.  In fact, he holds no position of authority, at least not in any official capacity.  Yet his peers regularly seek his counsel and follow it as if he were a superior.  The Lord Abbot himself seemed little more than a close disciple.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_BAKAL_RIGHT_0_00	This current adventure seems to both agitate and inspire [healer_hero], as if his soul somehow hangs in the balance.  I can understand now why [ranger_hero] would fear him.  Every now and then I see a determination in his eyes that rivals that of our pursuer.  I just pray that [healer_hero] will one day be able to find for himself the peace that he gives to others.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MANUSCRIPT_TITLE
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MANUSCRIPT_LEFT_0_00	Day 11 – A Carcassian Manuscript
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MANUSCRIPT_LEFT_0_10	<N>Cleared of all threat, the river outside of [healer_hero_pos] Chapter House has yielded a great bounty. ([berserker_hero], having finished with the revenant, spent the remainder of the day savagely depopulating the water of all other occupants.) While the resultant feast of broiled fish has most pleasantly filled my belly, it is one of the revenant corpses that fills my mind.<N><N>Of all that vile host we purged from the river, one carcass stood out from the rest. He had once been a herald of no small importance, judging by the quality of his dress, and the strange pattern and cut of his attire leads me to believe he hailed from one of the many Northern city states. While the rest of his accoutrements were far too damp-rotted to be of any use, he bore on his belt a watertight capsule of waxed leather. Inside, I discovered a still legible piece of parchment.<N><N>The contents validate my theory as to the man's origin. The text appears to be written in one of the many
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MANUSCRIPT_RIGHT_0_00	Northern languages with which I am woefully unfamiliar (my own specialization being the speech of Ash, ancient and modern, and the dialects of its surrounding peoples, especially our Western brethren.)<N><N>Perhaps it is some great moral flaw that my mind, surrounded by so much carnage and grief, still rejoices at such puzzles. It is a great comfort to me, even if it is also a great selfishness, to shut out the dark and bloody world which has become my life, and dedicate my energies wholeheartedly to the deciphering of some mysterious manuscript. If I close my eyes, I can almost feel myself back at the Library.<N><N>On my own, I have already been able to tease out several details, despite my ignorance of the language. I see, repeated several times, what appears to be a group of glyphs borrowed from the Nomad (a tongue which, at the risk of sounding boastful of my linguistic prowess, I shall admit to possessing a meager command of). It roughly translates to <LQ>ornamented woman,<RQ> or <LQ>Queen<RQ> (as I have seen it used in some texts), though perhaps <LQ>Woman of Many Symbols<RQ> would be closer to the literal meaning. The arrangement of the text around it
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MANUSCRIPT_LEFT_1_00	leads me to suspect that this Nomad loan may be a proper name, possibly that of the manuscript's author, or perhaps the intended recipient.<N><N>Such is the extent of the discoveries I can make on my own. I may call on the aid of [healer_hero], who I am told holds a not inconsiderable level of ability in several Carcassian tongues.<N><N>ADDENDUM:<N><N>[healer_hero] does indeed possess the skill with which his fellow monks credited him. Despite the obscurity of the dialect, he was able, within only a few moments, to present me with a translation of the text's opening line:<N><N><LQ>Return to me, my beloved,<RQ> Further progress was considerably slower, and the resulting interpretation far from complete, but a strange picture has begun to emerge. The second line, <LQ>And to our children who are weeping,<RQ> indicates that the relationship between the writer and recipient was far deeper than a tawdry love affair.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MANUSCRIPT_RIGHT_1_00	From there, [healer_hero] tells me the language becomes increasingly difficult, and the few words he can understand seem such gibberish that he begins to doubt his accuracy. <LQ>What voice have I to challenge the one you now hear?<RQ> is the only other complete statement [healer_hero] is able to produce. The remainder of the text is a mystery we cannot pierce, save for a word which [healer_hero] says could mean either <LQ>gray<RQ> or <LQ>dust,<RQ> several repetitions of the phrase <LQ>you return to blood,<RQ> and many uses of the proper name I discovered previously.<N><N>Hearing me say the name out loud, [ranger_hero] has corrected my understanding of the Nomad loan. In the Northeast (where it seems this manuscript originates), the word for <LQ>symbol<RQ> has somewhat different connotations. According to [ranger_hero], a more accurate translation of the phrase would be <LQ>Woman of Many Mystic Charms.<RQ> The magical quality of the woman has, sadly, not granted me any new insights into the text. All I can say is that she had, at the very least, bewitched the author's heart. Judging by the wealth apparent in his messenger, this Carcassian King (as I would guess) spared no expense in
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MANUSCRIPT_LEFT_2_00	seeking the return of his wayward woman of many mystic charms. Whether she heeded the pleading of her husband and children, or even received the message at all, is a mystery I doubt any shall ever know.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_NOMADS_LEFT_0_10	It has been very interesting seeing first hand the Nomad tribes, the indigenous people occupying the steppes and mountains between the cities of Ash and the Quaid Empire. Over one hundred different tribes were documented by Kantimal Polimon during his great excursion to the east, though I believe many of these to have been lost to the ravages of war. Here in the Pit I have met members of twenty-seven* different tribes, how many survive in the outside world is impossible to tell.<N><N>As the name suggests, the tribes live nomadically, raising goats and horses across the steppes.

Yet last night, for the first time since the fever visions of my early illness, I dreamt.<N><N>It was a dream so intense as to drive from my mind all the horrors of everything I have seen.  Indeed, all the experiences of my 23 years seemed to fade away in its presence.  <N><N>I stood on a high balcony.  I was not myself.  My arms were dark and shapely, covered in strange symbols and encircled by gold bands.  My dress was a multitude of jewels, such that the wealth of an entire nation could not make up more than the hem of my garment.

I drew down the fire moon and divided it between us.<N><N>I awoke trembling, clutching my hand to my heart as if it still held that red moon.  Such a great longing seized me that I wept.

Her eyes were screwed shut with the intensity of someone who believes the outside world can be forced into nonexistence through sheer willpower. Her lips mouthed strange Quaid words over and over till the rhythm of it surrounded her like tumultuous flood waters. She was trembling. I saw her for the merest fraction of a moment, but it seemed a glimpse of the eternal, as if this strange, pale girl would stand whispering her fury to the world's end and beyond.<N><N>After the battle, I asked her what it was that she was saying.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_THE_FOX_LEFT_0_10	When I was a child, I once found a dying fox in the gardens that surrounded the Royal Library. How this wild creature had reached the heart of the city is a mystery to me, but his presence had caused the silent patrons to forsake their meditations and attack the small beast with stones and fallen branches, their anger turning the gardens around them into an armory. Broken and bloodied, the fox had dragged himself into an alcove to die. I could hear his small whimpering breaths from the path where I walked with my mother. I darted away and slipped into the doorway of the alcove. The fox froze at my appearance. The whimpering stopped in his red mouth. He met me with a silence containing more pain and anger than any warning growl ever could. His eyes stayed locked with mine as my mother pulled me back to the path and out of view.<N><N>I am reminded of that moment as I sit here waiting in vain for sleep to take me. I braced myself for a violent tempest, but [mage_hero] has walked these ruined halls the whole day long in dispassion, seemingly unaffected by the signs of death all around her.

A full half of the text had been destroyed – as if the horror of the battle were so fierce even words could not escape. What remained appeared an elegant but hastily written Quaid. I presented it to [healer_hero], but he pronounced that the remaining script had no pertinence to our quest. He seemed eager to remove it from his gaze.<N><N>I do not know why I did what I did.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_THE_FOX_RIGHT_0_10	My dream has left me unsure of my own motivations.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_THE_FOX_RIGHT_0_20	I would like to say that I spoke to her out of a desire for friendship, or even simply idle curiosity, but I fear my actions were born of a hunger to hurt the only available target for all of my fear and hate. All my life the Quaid have been the invisible source of all anguish. Perhaps I merely wanted to see one suffer the pain of loss they so frequently inflicted upon us. Perhaps her calmness irritated me. Or perhaps I envied her strength and
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_THE_FOX_LEFT_1_00	wanted to break it. I do not know.<N><N>Whatever the reason, I took the scrap of parchment and gave it to [mage_hero]. She disappeared into her tent and returned sometime later with a freshly inked translation on new sheepskin. It reads as follows:

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_THE_FOX_RIGHT_1_00	They are obviously the words of one of the Quaid defenders, doomed to die in the siege.

As I stood pondering the ruined elegy, I was shocked to find the bottom of the page stained with tears.<N><N>I opened the flap to [mage_hero_pos] tent but stopped before I could say anything. She was curled in the far end, her flaxen hair hanging in limp strands over her face. Her fox eyes, incarnadined with sorrows I can never know, met mine.

They were a childhood obsession of my cousin's, and she hungrily devoured any legend I could find at the library, from Polimon's scientific postulations to Nomad folktales.  These stories were then regurgitated to me in typical childish fashion: backwards and scrambled and without pauses for breath.  Despite the quality of the lectures, a good deal of the material lodged in recesses of my mind.  Now that I keep company with a flesh and blood dragon, I find these childish lessons flooding back.<N><N>Over the course of this adventure I have learned to expect my preconceptions to be largely inaccurate when confronted with the living subject of my study.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_ASSASSIN_LEFT_0_10	I made a strange discovery today, in the curious, elated moments that always follow one of our hard-fought victories. We were sifting through the remnants of our fallen foes, looking for salvageable gear, when I found an item of a most peculiar nature.<N><N>It was similar to a lamellar harness, or what was left of one, with scraps of the thin gambeson that had once been worn beneath it. The plates were smaller, and their connections more intricate, than anything I have seen in our own armies or those of the Quaid. The delicate contours of its design, as well as the presence of fibers caught between the segments, lead me to believe that it was worn under regular clothing. This attempt at secrecy suggests to me that the armor in question was civilian, rather than military in origin.<N><N>The largest mystery posed by the harness is the damage which, lamentably, renders it unusable by our party. There is a hole, more than a hand's breadth wide, roughly where the wearer's heart would have been

I have seen it on countless vanquished revenant corpses, when I have used my meager powers to strike them down with the spirit of lightning. But this is not my work.<N><N>Most disturbingly, the damaged plates are flexed outwards, as if the terrifying heat and pressure had been exerted from the inside of the armor.<N><N>I cannot help but ask, what person would have worn such an outfit, and more vexing still, what would have killed them in such a bizarre manner?<N><N>ADDENDUM:<N><N>I am shaking still, as I write this, from the events that just transpired, and the death I just narrowly avoided.<N><N>I had begun to disassemble the cuirass I previously described, pulling the metal plates from their connecting silk cord, in the hopes of turning an

Still holding my wrist, he took his knife and cut open the seam of the gambeson. Inside were a row of sharp needles. He continued cutting down the length of the sleeve to reveal more hidden barbs. All told, there were 32 of them, each tipped with poison, sewn into the outer layer of fabric where one might grab an attacker's arm.<N><N>As [knight_hero] continued his dissection, we discovered a thin pocket, stitched into the sleeve's wrist. Inside was a piece of parchment, rolled on itself. The illustration was not unlike the many illuminated manuscripts I handled back in the great Library of Ash, though foreign in the style. Despite significant damage, the image is still discernible: a slender woman sits on a throne. Her face is obscured by scorch marks, but long white hair runs down her shoulders and mingles with the jewels around her neck. At her feet sit two boys, dark-skinned and golden eyed. The woman rests her hands on the boys' heads. Their hair, like hers, is white.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_ASSASSIN_RIGHT_1_00	The edges of the parchment are jagged, as if it was cut from some much larger page with a knife. Its reverse side is covered in an assortment of symbols of unknown origin, meticulously traced in black ink.<N><N>[knight_hero], for his part, tries to make light of the entire event. The barbs, he says, have most certainly sat for so long that their poison no longer holds any potency. He assures me that his intervention was simply to spare me a sore thumb. These are his words, but I see in his eyes a concern that betrays his jokes.<N><N>How he anticipated the existence of these stings within the assassin's harness is something I have been unable to drag out of him.

Deep in the bowels of a dead city, pursued by madmen and revenant, surrounded by chaos, it is nice to have a moment to actually enjoy something, even if it is a feast thrown by an overgrown lizard with delusions of divinity and a habit of threatening immolation for the slightest offense. How strange it is to see her caper about the bonfire with her offspring. For lack of any better word, she seems happy, if such an emotion can be applied to a monster.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DREAM2_LEFT_0_00	Day 25 - Second Dream
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DREAM2_LEFT_0_10	The dream came to me again last night.  It was a different form, but I could tell it was the same dream - or at least I was the same dreamer.<N><N>I was standing in a great hall.  Its walls stretched up above me, towering so high that the ceiling was made of clouds.  Each wall was golden-bright and adorned with wondrous jewels as far as my eye could see.  In my hands was a goblet, carved from some lustrous material, wine-dark and cold to the touch.  <N><N>Despite all the wonders that surrounded me, I treasured the goblet above all things, carrying it so as to not spill a single drop from its lip. Suddenly the hall darkened and a filthy rabble surged into it. They struck me and abused me and tore the goblet from my hands. I screamed and drew a sharp dagger from my robes, slashing and striking out at them until the hall was dark with blood.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DREAM2_RIGHT_0_00	Despite their losses the throng pressed against me till I was forced out of the hall, into a dim antechamber. I fought, but all around the horde struck back till I was completely broken. I collapsed, and the rabble rushed over me, eager to tear down the bright jewels from the walls. <N><N>I lay for a long time, believing myself to have died. When I finally could climb to my feet, the hall was empty. The walls had been torn down and smashed, and everything was covered in soot and filth. I looked, but the goblet was nowhere. I wandered the hall for an eternity, crying out, but I was alone. The goblet had been taken from me. <N><N>I sat down in the ruin and wept.

Indeed, it was only by the hushed reverence with which my mother drew me back that I knew he was any different from the other crippled veterans who joined us at the Temple Fountain.<N><N>I remember how he lifted another soldier, crutch-bound, with an empty sleeve where his right arm should have been, so the younger man could drink from the Fountain. I remember how he continued standing, long after the younger man limped away. I remember how the light caught the tears that ran from his uncovered eye, down his beard, and into the pure Temple water.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_ZELEMIR_DEAD_RIGHT_0_00	And now he is dead, and I have killed him.<N><N>To become a regicide is a bitter feeling.  It was the only reasonable thing, I tell my mind, but I have still spilled the royal blood of Ash.  He had so deviated from his purpose as to endanger the entire order of being.  Still, the feeling haunts me.  It is the first time I have killed a true man of flesh and blood.<N><N>[mage_hero] oscillates between glee and anger, cursing his name as if she could kill the dead all over again.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_GIBBERISH_LEFT_0_10	[knight_hero] woke me today. We had paused briefly to consume some small scraps of food, and I, weary from the long march, reclined in the cool stone archway we had just passed. Sleep, which has troubled me somewhat of late, came easily for once. My slumber cannot have lasted more than a few moments. Presently I opened my eyes to find [knight_hero] standing in front of me. He informed me that we had to press on, and, as he took the path in front of me, added that I had been speaking gibberish in my sleep.<N><N>Though it may have been mere nonsense to his ears, I felt meaning clinging to the corners of my half-sleeping mind.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_WRENNASTORY_LEFT_0_10	I continue to discover great chasms between the world around me, as it stands in actuality, and the carved and colored interpretation of it that sits in my mind. It seems I have spent most of my life judging, not things themselves, but the intellectual fabrications I have created of them.<N><N>As we sat around the campfire tonight, [mage_hero] began to tell a story. I braced myself, expecting a journey into the grim and macabre: casual killings at a young age, or the violent fervor of the zealot.<N><N>Instead, she told a story about her youngest sister.<N><N>This child, seven years [mage_hero_pos] junior, envied the older girl's mobility. So great was this feeling of inadequacy that she took to – at unexpected moments – clambering onto [mage_hero_pos] back, and so parasitically assuming the height and athleticism she coveted. [mage_hero] soon became adept at removing this unwanted passenger, to the young girl's great frustration. This
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_WRENNASTORY_RIGHT_0_00	continued for some time, with the youngest repeatedly attaching herself to the oldest, only to be immediately unseated. One day [mage_hero] woke to find her sister perched at the head of her bed, laboriously covering herself with the contents of a pilfered jar of honey, hoping, with this makeshift adhesive in place, to permanently bond herself to her chosen beast of burden.<N><N>[mage_hero] ended the story and looked at me with an expectant, girlish grin. It was some moments before I realized she was waiting for my laughter.<N><N>What a strange and new reaction it was for me. The [mage_hero] of my mind elicited only fear or pity. Her portrait was either that of a grim and terrible warlord, even in her personable moments expressing a humor drenched in blood, voiced with the laughter of the fanatic, or else the pained and broken child, a helpless object on which to pour out all my self-righteous pity.<N><N>How grave my misconceptions are, which seek to condense the human soul to a simple object, pertinent only in its relation to me.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_EVILINSIDE_LEFT_0_10	Selinadt said in his Second Letter to King Vekalimon, <LQ>When men embrace the evil inside themselves, there can be no victors.<RQ><N><N>It is a bitter lesson, to be reminded of one's own failings. I had believed myself to be a true and ardent follower of Selinadt (a pride that I see now as itself a grave fault.) But surely, I reasoned, one such as I – steeped in verses from childhood, regular patron of the Temple – could consider herself on the righteous path? Despite this, I secretly held throughout my life the delusion that evil was something purely external. First it was the Quaid, architects of all the pain and misery I ever saw throughout my early life. While I read daily about the evil in my own heart, I secretly told myself that none of it could compare to the evil of the armies of the East, murderers and ravagers, men who had made themselves animals. All around me the lamentation of widows, the weeping of orphans, the cries of crippled veterans, all the keening of the city was made by my selfish mind into words of affirmation.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_EVILINSIDE_RIGHT_0_00	<LQ>No evil I harbor,<RQ> I said in my heart, <LQ>Can be equal to this.<RQ><N><N>Even in this current adventure, which has served to disabuse me of many misconceptions, I maintained this fantasy of purity. No matter the secret thoughts of my heart, I could point to Ozimal or Zelemir and say <LQ>there is the true evil.<RQ><N><N>The way of Selinadt, in usual circuitous faction, has showed to me the grievous folly of my secret beliefs. Here in the belly of this dead city, clutched in the hand of what had once been a knight of Ash, I found a scroll. In the flowering calligraphy of a skillful hand were written the following words:
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_EVILINSIDE_RIGHT_0_10	My dearest Master Elder,<N><N>In response to your excommunication, I would like to clarify that I have only ever acted in complete moral adherence to the tenants of our faith. You proclaim that the decimation of the prisoners under my care violates the responsibility of my position and my duty before the Unmoved Mover, but I assure you that the
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_EVILINSIDE_LEFT_1_00	opposite is true.<N><N>You remember, no doubt, when the enemy came against the city of Terna. Seeking to terrify the rest of Ash into submission, they swore that no quarter would be offered to the beleaguered defenders. On that black day when the city fell, we saw that oath to be true. But the enemy was not content with the massacre of the garrison and turned their fury on the populace, disregarding age, youth, and sex in their senseless rage. By the day's end, thirty thousand men, women, and children lay slaughtered. Terna was nothing but ashes, populated by scarcely enough souls to recount the horror of what was done there.<N><N>For this reason is my every tenth prisoner burned alive. Until thirty thousand die by my hand, the immolations shall continue, for the edification of the prisoners and the achievement of true balance. This is my solemn oath by the very gold of the Fountain, and not even the threats of a misguided cleric shall keep me from honoring it.<N><N>– General Keznimon Kalredos
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_EVILINSIDE_RIGHT_1_00	I knew this man. I – I see, as if lit by lightning, the great darkness that lurks in every soul. More than any other, I see it in my own. How easy it would be to embrace corruption rather than fight it. There is a sweet and familiar taste difficult to describe – have I lived so long with hate that I have grown to love it? I look at the horror on the page before me and I see the vilest sin. But how easy it would have been to commit. How sweet it would have felt to drink deeply from that secret stream in my heart, to inflict the pain and loss, to feel my soul dance with the dark joy of revenge. I think of [mage_hero] weeping in her tent – my evil, inflicted by my modest means. What would I have done with true power?<N><N>When men embrace the evil inside themselves, there can be no victors.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MARKOSSTORY_LEFT_0_10	To Lady [mcguffin_hero] Livbar from [knight_hero] Kashantir, Knight of the Host of Ash.<N><N>You asked me, some time ago, how it was I anticipated the danger hidden within the strange armor you discovered. As you correctly guessed, I do have a previous experience with an assassin similarly outfitted. While I rebuffed your curiosity at the time, I have had some days to think on the matter, and have decided to relate to you my experience.<N><N>This is not a story I divulge frequently, nor, if I can help it, think on.<N><N>It was a grim time. The plague would not come for another two years. In those days, it seemed, nothing could stop the Quaid war machine. The Eastern provinces were stained red with the blood of their people, and incursions had begun to break into even the heart of Ash.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MARKOSSTORY_RIGHT_0_00	My father was dead. My brothers were dead. I came forward, the eldest living male of the house of Kashantir, to fight. There were many like me, boys of noble birth who had spent their whole lives training but never yet spilled mansblood. Below us were boys younger still: commoners, peddlers, farmer's sons fresh from the fields, all summoned to give their lives for Ash.<N><N>It was a sign of the kingdom's desperation, I suppose, that such a delicate task was given to us.<N><N>Spies had brought news of a Quaid general making camp with his advance party, the foremost point of the fire worshipers' claw sunk into the heart of Ash. His guards were few, the spies said, the time to strike was now.<N><N>Our commander was ill prepared for such an action. The bulk of his troops were untested recruits, my age or younger, and his Nomad auxiliaries were deserting at a steady pace. He had no reserves, no veterans to call on, and scarcely enough gold to field more than a handful of mercenaries.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MARKOSSTORY_LEFT_1_00	He found a single man.<N><N>I had heard stories of such Carcassians, assassins bred from centuries of war between the Northern city states, men who valued murder itself more than the gold they were paid to commit it. I had always dismissed them as mere soldier's tales.<N><N>Looking at the man, I began to wonder if I had not misjudged.<N><N>He had no hair, as far as I could see, not on his face, nor his brow, nor his pate, nor the backs of his hands. I had never seen any living thing so still. He did not speak, but occasionally, and with no provocation, he would laugh, and when he did the teeth that showed were all midnight black. The men called him the Shade Drinker.<N><N>Our orders were simple: deliver the Carcassian to the enemy camp, and provide whatever assistance he might require in his task.<N><N>The weather was against us. A thick fog had descended during the night, and in the predawn darkness we
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MARKOSSTORY_RIGHT_1_00	quickly lost our way. Unwilling to call out, lest we betray ourselves to the enemy, our small number was quickly separated. With rising dread, I realized I was alone in the mist.<N><N>I wandered for a great time, stumbling in my blindness, terrified that every step would discover me to the enemy. Presently I came upon a form in the mist. He was a Quaid guard, dead, red with his own blood. He had no eyelids.<N><N>I had stumbled into the enemy camp, and I was not alone.<N><N>Ahead of me, crouched between two tents, was another figure. I could not make out the man's features, but I reasoned by his stance that he too was an intruder. Creeping to the man's location, I reached out to touch his shoulder and alert him of my presence. Without turning, he caught my arm.<N><N>Cracking a black-toothed grin so wide it seemed to split his face in half, the Shade Drinker pointed at the tent in
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MARKOSSTORY_LEFT_2_00	front of us. Its flap was embroidered with the Imperial crest of Quaid. Its guard was already dead.<N><N>Still holding my arm, the Carcassian entered the general's tent, drawing me after him. The general lay on a cot at the far end, surrounded by maps and scrolls and other accoutrements of command. Even lying down, I could tell he was a giant of a man, head and shoulders taller than I, and larger still than the slender Carcassian. Releasing me, the Shade Drinker crept to the general's foot. From some unseen sheath, he produced a small knife. He held it over his head for a moment, and it seemed to me time hung still. With a sudden jerk, he brought the knife down into the sleeping Quaidman.<N><N>The general sprang to his feet with a gasp. The knife still protruding from his ribs, he seized the Carcassian by the shoulders and hurled the smaller man across the tent. Drawing his sword from where it lay next to his cot, the Quaidman closed the distance between them with a single step. Fearing for my companion's life, I drew my sword and made ready to strike the advancing giant. My blow was checked by the strange sound of the Carcassian's laughter.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MARKOSSTORY_RIGHT_2_00	He lay, sprawled where the general had tossed him, black teeth shining in grotesque mirth. The giant's demeanor changed. His sword fell from his trembling hands. Like a crumbling tower, he collapsed, his great body wracked by convulsions.<N><N>With a wordless cry, the Carcassian was on him, straddling the dying man as he pried out his knife. I watched in the fear as the assassin reached out both his hands and began to make ablutions with the Quaidman's last ragged breaths, scooping them up and over his head and pouring them out as if they were water.<N><N>As the general's wheezing turned to silence, the Carcassian ended his ritual. He turned and saw me where I stood, still holding my undelivered blow. He made another black-toothed grin at me and peeled back the cloth on his shoulder to reveal a row of barbs, loaded with the venom that had taken his victim's life.<N><N>Taking my wrist again, he led me out of the tent, to the edge of the camp. He paused for a moment, hunched
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MARKOSSTORY_LEFT_3_00	over in the mist and darkness, and I could hear him scratching something. Then, with a smile almost paternal, he handed me his knife. In the worn leather of the grip were carved strange characters. I looked up, and he was flanked by another four figures, clad and black-toothed smiling as he was. As one, they stepped backwards, into the mist and out of view.<N><N>Our commander choked to death in his sleep several weeks later, and the story spread throughout all the men that it was the Shade Drinker come back for his payment.<N><N>Years later, I met another soldier educated in some of the languages of the Carcassians. I showed him the knife, and he translated the characters for me. They said <LQ>Many lives to you, boy.<RQ>

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DREAM3_LEFT_0_10	I dreamed again last night.<N><N>I was standing in a desolate place.  Before me stood a gigantic crystal, rising up a hundred feet into the sky.  I was weeping.  The tears ran down my body, across my gold and charms, and out onto the ground.  They snaked across the dusty earth towards the crystal and I realized that they were no longer tears but rivulets of blood.  <N><N>There was a host of corpses at my feet - men, women, and children.  My hands were caked with their gore.  I turned and saw an army behind me, covered, as I was, in blood.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_EMPRESS_LEFT_0_10	I must express some disquiet with the ghost town in which we find ourselves visitors. While the various necessities a company such as ours has have been met by the same assortment of merchants and tradesmen found in every settlement of the Pit, the people here feel unsound. They are Quaid, mostly, and carry themselves with such a quiet fervor I find myself secretly cataloging escapes whenever one of their number addresses me.<N><N>[knight_hero], especially, seems agitated. He has spoken very little about his time in the war, but I can tell their speech and dress brings back evil memories to his mind. He no longer jokes as is his usual wont, but instead paces to and fro, fidgeting to keep his hands away from the grip of his sword.<N><N>Even the rangers and other mercenaries who work for whatever scraps the town can give them seem distrustful of their wards.

He was clad in rags, and foam flecked his wild blond beard. With a cry that was half scream, half laughter, he hurled himself at her feet, groveling in the mud, clutching at the hem of her cloak.<N><N>It was as if he had broken some invisible barrier. All at once, the populace descended upon [mage_hero],

For a fleeting moment, my eyes met [mage_hero_pos]. They contained a look of such sheer terror as I have never before seen. She disappeared into the grasping hands of the crowd.

The tatters of her cloak billowed like the sail of a warship. A small trail of blood ran down her forehead.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_EMPRESS_RIGHT_1_00	With a voice stronger than any I could imagine her small body capable of, she roared in Quaid. The people prostrated themselves. It seemed to me as if an entire host joined her words.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_BLACKROBES_LEFT_0_10	[berserker_hero] has begun gathering the bloodsoaked robes of the fallen cultists for some project I prefer to know nothing of. It is strange to see the faces behind the masks, though they be twisted with their sudden transformation into revenant. They are mutilated, many of them, with what I can only assume are self-inflicted wounds. Despite all this, one can still see the men they once were. At one time, they would not have seemed out of place in the company of Nomads.<N><N>[mage_hero] is strangely joyed to have faced them, as if to fight the same enemy as her grandfather is to share in that hero's glory. The cultists, as she explained to me, were once the greatest threat to the Quaid Empire. United under the banner of a central matriarchy, the madmen were a kingdom in their own right, launching full-scale invasions to feed their never-ending appetite for sacrificial victims. Generations of Quaid fought them to a standstill, but it was not until [mage_hero_pos] grandfather that the Empire was able to go on the offensive. His victories were swift and brutal; apparently, after
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_BLACKROBES_RIGHT_0_00	generations of success, the cultists had become victims of their own degeneracy. The once powerful institution of matriarch had given way to a disorganized ruling class of high priests, each eager for his own power more than the good of the whole. Without the centralized authority of the <LQ>Queen of Many Devils<RQ> (as the Quaid termed the office), the cultists were unable to provide a unified resistance, and fell under the might of the Quaid offensive.<N><N>Until the coming of the plague years, [mage_hero] and her people had believed the blood-cultists all but exterminated. Now, in this time of chaos, it seems the madmen have returned, fueled by a power new and dark. The timing is no coincidence. Eztli-Tenoch has found his minions, men who willingly sacrifice their humanity for his sake.<N><N>[ranger_hero] called them the <LQ>tribes anathema,<RQ> which, coupled with their appearance, leads me to wonder if these men were not once Nomads such as she. What would have persuaded them to take on the life they now have (or had), my mind cannot fathom.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_BLACKROBES_LEFT_1_00	[ranger_hero] remains reticent on the subject. Beyond her initial, almost giddy statements, given in the immediate aftermath of the battle, she has said nothing more. Apparently, it is one thing to celebrate a victory, and another entirely to indulge the <LQ>obnoxious curiosity<RQ> of a foreigner. Perhaps my inquisitiveness is thoughtless. When she believes no one looking, I see [ranger_hero] fingering the fox idol around her neck, her eyes flitting nervously amongst the fallen forms of our new enemies.<N><N>That the Geka, and a young [ranger_hero] with them, had some grim dealings with these madmen in the past seems a certainty.<N><N>For once, I feel it is I who have been crass and flippant.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_BLACKROBES_LEFT_1_10	I cannot help but think back to [ranger_hero_pos] secret prayer to be delivered from <LQ>those set apart,<RQ> and her near suicidal debt to the sons of Krast.

I filled the infinity with thoughts of all I had lost and all I had taken – my tears were venom, my mind a worthy victim. The cold of the darkness froze my tears to my body. I ran still, but there was no escape. What I fled was myself.<N><N>Finally, after many long ages I saw – I cannot call it a light, for that would compare it to the light which I had lost. It was simply a lessening of the darkness. But I had spent so long in the deep black, deprived of all sensation save my own grief, that the presence seemed escape. I turned and saw before me a small candle, meager and dim, fluttering in the cold night wind. Still weeping, I came close and watched as it tried to warm me.<N><N>It was not a candle, but a man, small and gray. I watched as he set out the dusty baubles of his courtship,
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DREAM4_LEFT_1_00	the best his kingdom of cobwebs had to offer. I looked at him and I felt nothing. In that moment the nothingness in my heart was the most blissful reprieve – to have the churning, anguished storm of my mind replaced with a void… It was more than I could ever hope for or deserve. To feel nothing was the most joyous fantasy… I embraced oblivion.<N><N>From that embrace there came a bitter joy. I drew my hands back and found they each held a small flame.<N><N>I wept again. What a birthright they had been robbed of, these small lights of mine. They should have been stars.<N><N>I took the two pieces of my heart, the twin boys with golden skin and hair, like mine, the color of starlight. I clasped them to my chest as they cried out for the father they should have had, the father they could never know. Here they were, curiosities in a lonely kingdom, children of hunger.<N><N>The darkness grew darker still.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DREAM4_RIGHT_1_00	In my weeping, I had extinguished the candle.<N><N>I woke, my lips mouthing strange words I could not recognize – names I dare not think on.

But why should it?  What respect does evil command?  This golden man is nothing more than a bully grasping at godhood.  There is something fundamentally pathetic in this kind of evil.  It smacks of the same self-delusion of would-be great men.  Look at this place: an entire palace dedicated to reinforcing a self-created image.  Look at me, it screams, I am the true face of power.  Eztli-Tenoch the god, impotent in his crystal cage.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_THRONE_ROOM_RIGHT_0_00	Yet there is another side of me that understands.  A side of me that has walked these halls, that has known godhood.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_EVNI_LEFT_0_10	Against all sense and logic and reason, I have purchased [berserker_hero] his <LQ>true love.<RQ> I shall never forgive myself.<N><N>This can be said of [berserker_hero]: he is not one of those capricious men who, upon obtaining the object of their desire, immediately grow tired of it.<N><N>Evni has become a full member of our company. <LQ>She<RQ> has a reserved place at meals.

[berserker_hero] wailed and beat his breast (which had, incidentally, successfully crushed the insect), thinking his own clumsiness the cause for Evni's misfortune. I caught [ranger_hero_pos] eye and held it just long enough to let her know her wickedness had not gone unmarked. She actually bared her teeth at me.<N><N>ADDENDUM:<N><N>I accidentally exacted a strange revenge, I think, later in the day. Evni was resting in the shade as [berserker_hero] collected flowers with which to construct a bower for her <LQ>midafternoon nap.<RQ> As I walked past, I stumbled upon [ranger_hero].

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_EPILOGUE_LEFT_0_10	What an odd feeling it is to stand still and say <LQ>Nothing at all is trying to kill me right now.<RQ><N><N>I'm still not sure I believe it.  I keep waiting for murderous sheep to charge down the library halls.  So far it's just been a mouse, which was quickly dispatched with Polimon's Treatise on the Right Functioning of Plants.<N><N>[knight_hero] has become quite a regular at the library.  This last month he has wanted to see practically every military treatise I could lay my hands on and, having exhausted sensible subjects, has branched out into just about anything I can pull off the shelf.  I think the last thing he looked up was a manual on ferret breeding which I swear he picked at random, and then spent the entire visit talking to me instead of reading.  I knew something had to be crazy about him.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_EPILOGUE_RIGHT_0_00	Still, it's nice to have someone to talk to while restocking the shelves.  So many books were burned as fuel during the plague, the library has been decimated.  The shelves were almost skeletally empty when I arrived.  <N><N>[knight_hero] has donated several he's purchased from Nomad traders and yesterday I received a mysterious package addressed <LQ>TO [mcguffin_hero_up] AT HER BORING JOB THAT IS MUCH LESS AWESOME THAN MINE WHICH IS KILLING THINGS<RQ><N><N>Inside were several incredibly rare Western texts dating back at least three centuries, as well as a series of crudely drawn stick figures labeled <LQ>ME<RQ>, each killing various monstrosities.  All of these will be saved for posterity in the renovated East Wing, along with this record, as soon as it is finished.<N><N>I often wonder how my old companions are faring.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_EPILOGUE_LEFT_1_00	It has only been two months time, but I know that two months is several hundred adventures for the likes of [berserker_hero] and [ranger_hero].<N><N>I have heard little word on [mage_hero], though every now and again Nomad traders mention the <LQ>Mad Empress of the Ruins,<RQ> which I can only assume means that she is doing well in her reconquest.<N><N>Sometimes I fear for her - with the plague and its Revenant vanished, the Quaid Empire will be an inviting territory for every would-be warlord and bandit king, not to mention the kingdoms of the North.  Still, if anyone can fight the whole world and win smiling, it would be [mage_hero].<N><N>[healer_hero] has returned to his monastery.  I receive letters on occasion, detailing the Pit's slow transformation.  Traders, travellers and pilgrims are slowly making inroads, though it will be some time before the stigma

The city is rebuilding and with it comes the hectic city life that I no longer thrive on.<N><N>My eyes crave open land and the distant horizon.  Perhaps there is some adventurer in me after all.  I have no doubt [knight_hero] and his guards would accompany me, so the trip would hold little to no danger and, if he can be coaxed to sing again, little to no boredom.<N><N>I believed [dragon_hero] to have permanently removed herself from the world of <LQ>mortals,<RQ> but I am no longer certain.  Last week a bundle of gold-bound books were left on top of the Library roof.  It would take a skilled climber indeed to take such a great weight up such a great height. I would like to believe our mysterious benefactor had the gift of flight, which would mean a certain self proclaimed god has found a mate to train her children.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_EPILOGUE_LEFT_2_00	It is a happy thought, and I will stick with it.<N><N>It is strange to speak to people outside of our little party.  The few I have even begun to confide in have either scoffed at my claims or already been spoiled by the widely exaggerated stories of the returning refugees.  <N><N>This morning two children stopped me in the street and begged me to melt the face off of a bully that was tormenting them.  Always with the face melting.  An angry glare sent him scurrying home for a change of clothes, which went over better with my audience than a melted face ever would have.  I have had others rush up to me in the street, asking me to heal their bunions, bless their donkeys, curse their annoying neighbors, the list goes on.<N><N>Perhaps that is why I am so happy to see [knight_hero] come into the Library.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_EPILOGUE_RIGHT_2_00	We never speak of our past adventures, but there is an understanding there, a common footing that I will never share with anyone who was not a member of our company.<N><N>I wonder, will we all ever see each other again?<N><N>-[mcguffin_hero] Yalkie Livbar

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_PLATEMAIL_LEFT_10	A lot of people like to throw around the term <LQ>plate mail.<RQ> When it appeared in Defender's Quest as the name for some of our heavy armor items, I immediately stopped what I was doing (staring inappropriately at German longsword fencing manuscripts) and leapt into action. You see, <LQ>plate mail<RQ> is a stupid and redundant term that should never be attached anything of any value whatsoever. But… If there's <LQ>chain mail,<RQ> then plate armor would be, like, <LQ>plate mail,<RQ> right? WRONG!<N><N>The word <LQ>mail<RQ> (or <LQ>maille,<RQ> if you're feeling fancy), comes from the medieval French word for <LQ>chain.<RQ> The phrase <LQ>chain mail<RQ> is a redundancy the didn't pop up until the 19th century. Once <LQ>chain mail<RQ> entered the popular vocabulary, people lost the original meaning of the <LQ>mail<RQ> part and kind of filled in that it just meant <LQ>like armor or something I guess.<RQ> They then started sticking it on the end of everything that should've just been called armor.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_DIMENSIONS_LEFT_00	A Note on Dimensions
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_DIMENSIONS_LEFT_10	For those of you that are interested in the nature of the <LQ>halfway world,<RQ> here's a description of how dimensions function from one of our internal design documents:<N><N>Reality is made up of many different layers. What we perceive is the combination of a fraction of each <LQ>dimension<RQ> or <LQ>realm.<RQ> Color, taste, touch, smell, etc. are all tiny glimpses into their own dimension. Only the tip of the iceberg intersects with the world. But with intense concentration, one can separate the layers and fully experience a dimension in its entirety. The <LQ>realm<RQ> we will be dealing with the most is the <LQ>shadow<RQ> realm, as it is called by the characters. The shadow realm is the dimension of spirit – something like the platonic ideal, but for each object in existence. Every living thing is animated by an invisible force that we only barely experience, but in the shadow realm this spiritual force can be fully experienced and interacted with. As the healer explains it:

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_ACTQUOTES_LEFT_00	Act Intro Quotes
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_ACTQUOTES_LEFT_10	Some of my favorite things to write were the little bits of flavor text that opened each act of the story. They really let me experiment with other voices and give the player little glimpses into the larger world that the story was set in. When it came to start act seven, I actually came up with three different quotes and then picked a favorite to use in the game. Here are the two that didn't make the cut:<N><N><LQ>When faced with a decision, the selfish man thinks on a multitude of outcomes, weighing which option will yield him the best return.  The true man thinks only of which will serve the Flame.<RQ><N>- From the Book of Seven Wisdoms on the Path of the Blade<N><N><LQ>I look at the faces of our Northern mercenaries and I see the despair of a man who has gambled and lost.  We shall all die, but I shall die for my home, for my family, for the King and the Temple.  They shall die for a paltry sum of gold.<RQ><N>- Unknown defender, Siege of Karedon's Pass
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_ACTQUOTES_RIGHT_0_00	The one that finally made it into the game is this:<N><N><LQ>It is said that men fear death.  In my experience, what men truly fear is the uncertainty of death.  In all that ordeal, when death was the only conceivable outcome, I was possessed by an unassailable calm I have never felt before or since.  It was only when the chance of survival appeared that I felt the true grip of terror.<RQ><N>- from the Memoirs of Gedemon Dalavbar, Master of Archers, being a History of his Adventures and Exploits in Service to the Ash King<N><N>This quote was highly inspired by a passage from Shadow of the Torturer, by Gene Wolfe, which I began reading as I was finishing work on Defender's Quest. (I didn't realize this inspiration until long after I finish writing the piece.) It's an incredibly strange, often disturbing book, which I would not recommend to younger readers. However, for mature audiences who are interested in taking a journey to a new and alien place, the book captures a sense of otherness in its world and values rarely found in modern fiction.<N><N>Speaking of inspirations, the idea of each act having an
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_ACTQUOTES_LEFT_1_00	introductory bit of flavor text was taken from Thief: The Dark Projekt, one of my favorite games of all time. I don't think I've ever played anything else that had such a lavishly imagined, nuanced, and hauntingly beautiful setting. Master thief Garrett silently slipping through the shadows of The City, amidst grinding industrial machines and occult horrors, passing unseen through the warring factions of magic and reason is an image that will stay with me for the rest of my life. Sometimes I cry when I think about it. Although, that may have more to do with all the paint I ate as a kid...

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_BERSERKERS_LEFT_00	Berserkers and Proper Scabbard Placement
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_BERSERKERS_LEFT_10	Boy, it sure looks cool when a killer swordsman keeps his awesome sword on a scabbard on his back instead of on his side like a normal person! So cool, in fact, that I initially designed the Berserkers to look like this. Fortunately, my sublimated spirit of neurotic historical obsession materialize in front of me, slapped me in the face with a hand clad in 100% authentic riveted mail, and pointed out that keeping your sword on your back is the dumbest thing anyone could ever do ever.<N><N>But Link! And Geralt! And ninjas!<N><N>To which the spirit of neurotic historical obsession says:<N><N>Your back is a great place to keep things if you just want to carry them around. For instance, backpacks.<N><N>However, if you want to be able to draw a weapon you will discover that it is impossible to do so from your back. Go ahead, try it out. It's a Herculean effort to pull
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_BERSERKERS_RIGHT_0_00	out anything of any length from a sheath. (One of the Roman emperors that I'm too lazy to look up at the moment – Hadrian, I think? – actually bragged in one of his writings that London was such a subjugated city his troops could walk through the streets with their weapons on their backs. Because… if there was danger of you getting attacked… you'd want to have your weapons where you could actually reach them.)<N><N>Next time you see some movie where some super cool dude keeps his sword on his back (or better yet, two swords), watch closely when he draws it. You'll notice the film always conveniently cuts – he gets a couple inches out of the scabbard (with the appropriate metal-on-metal shing noise that by the way would only ever happened if something was scratching the crap out of your blade) and then magically it cuts to him with the sword all the way out. This is because the in between part is anatomically impossible – you can't draw anything longer than your arm from your back. At least, not without dislocating something.<N><N>Now, there are some people who are so obsessed with
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_BERSERKERS_LEFT_1_00	the coolness of drawing things from your back that they've designed special sheaths that exist only to do this. They're this weird kind of half scabbard sort of thing and they look stupid and they are stupid only stupid people use them and they still won't work as well as drawing it from your side. (A lot of them actually put a big metal ring right at the top, so you do get that metal-on-metal shing noise… You know, because this big metal ring is grinding the edge off of your sword.)<N><N>Anyways, the point is people are obsessed with how <LQ>cool<RQ> it looks to draw your sword from your back even though it will never, ever – even if you designed some sort of super sheath with this express purpose in mind – work like drawing it from your side like a normal person.<N><N>Fortunately, I corrected my grave error, and now all of our Berserkers use correct, physiologically possible sheath placement. Then I spent two hours watching German Longsword Fencing videos on YouTube and weeping for my sins.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_BERSERKERS_RIGHT_1_00	PS: You'll notice, in 3-D games where characters keep a sword on their backs, that the sword magically clips through the sheath rather than being drawn through the mouth of it.<N><N>PPS: some Napoleonic and the Victorian military sabers feature metal sheaths with a metal spring in the mouth that presses against the blade to keep it snugly in place, so when drawn they do actually create that metal-on-metal shing noise that the movies love so much. This spring also wears on the blade, so if you find still extant sabers of this variety, they will oftentimes have significant blade wear where the spring has rubbed against them every single time they're drawn. So yes, that cool shing noise does come from something, however it's very limited, and still bad for the swords long-term. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go flog myself while reading sword and buckler fencing manuals.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_BOSSREVENANT_LEFT_00	Boss Revenant
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_BOSSREVENANT_LEFT_10	For those of you who are curious about our boss revenant, here's an explanation from one of our internal design documents:<N><N>Some revenant may be more powerful than others, depending on how much spiritual focus the wizard is giving that particular pawn. Furthermore, some <LQ>shells<RQ> are more conducive than others. For instance, a powerful necromancer could inhabit the corpses of squirrels. And while an army of zombie squirrels would be pretty hilarious, squirrels do not have the same depth of spiritual existence that humans do – less of the their being is in the shadow realm. Basically, the bigger a void left by a soul, the more room there is for the wizard to fill it with his own spiritual focus (ideally as soon as the thing dies – as a corpse rots, so does its spiritual dimensions, so the older a corpse gets, the less it can do). This carries over to people as well. Not everyone has as much room for the wizard to work in. Shallow vessels can only carry a small amount of his spirit, and won't allow him to do things that require more energy
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_BOSSREVENANT_RIGHT_0_00	than they can hold. On the other hand, some people have significantly more spiritual depth and allow him a lot more room to work in – the newer a corpse is, the more spiritual void is left for him to fill.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_CHIEFTANSTUNIC_LEFT_00	Chieftan's Tunic and the World Tree
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_CHIEFTANSTUNIC_LEFT_10	The twisting roots of the World Tree that decorate the Chieftain's Tunic was part of my many efforts to imply a deeper culture and folklore to our various factions, in this case the Nomads.<N><N>A lot of real-world cultures have the concept of a World Tree, but I was inspired specifically by a very strange bit of Greek folklore I read about which involved some Balkan goblins called Kallikantzaroi. The Kallikantzaroi spend the entire year underground, sawing at the roots of the World Tree in hopes of causing it (and therefore the world) to collapse. The Kallikantzaroi are just jackasses like that, I guess. Anyways, the only time they stop trying to kill the world is on Christmas, which arrives just as they are about to saw all the way through the World Tree. Starting on Christmas, they get to come up to the surface and run around peeing in people's beer, stealing candy from babies, sticking your toothbrush in the toilet, and generally being ass-clowns of the highest caliber. All their fun ends on the day of
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_CHIEFTANSTUNIC_RIGHT_0_00	Epiphany, when they are banished back down into the earth. They arrive to discover that the joke is in fact on them and the World Tree has healed entirely from all of their sawing. This happens every single year, because the Kallikantzaroi aren't just ass-hats, they're incredibly stupid ass-hats. (I like to imagine that the World Tree went and peed in all of their beer while they were gone.)<N><N>Oh, and if you want to protect your beer, baby-candy, and toothbrushes from the Kallikantzaroi, all you have to do is put a colander out on your porch. Kallikantzaroi can only count as high as the number two – since three, being the number of the Trinity, is a holy number, if one of the Kallikantzaroi says it out loud, they will immediately die. So if you stick a colander on your porch, those punk ass Kallikantzaroi will stay up all night trying to count all of the holes in it but always losing count after the number two. Then you just get up first thing in the morning, bust out your trusty .45, cap those tragically math-obsessed fools in their collective keister, put the bodies down the garbage disposal, and enjoy urine-free beer for the rest of the holiday season. At least, that's how I imagine it going down.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_CUTCHARS_LEFT_00	Cut Characters: the Paladin and the Protector
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_CUTCHARS_LEFT_10	We were originally going to have an even larger party roster, but had to cut characters in order to keep things at a more manageable size. Among the guys that ended up on the chopping block were the Paladin and the Protector.<N><N>The Protector was going to be a heavily defensive <LQ>tank<RQ> type unit who carried a massive shield. His whole shtick was that he could shield, not just himself, but also nearby allies. So when a defender next to him would have normally gotten hit, the Defender would zap in and block the shot with his shield. Story wise, if I remember correctly, the Protector was going to be part of an elite fanatical military unit from Ash that believed it had a moral obligation to defend any land on which one of its members had shed blood. Elements of the Protector were recycled for Markos the Knight, although the more fanatical <LQ>Our blood! The blood of patriots!<RQ> aspects were left on the cutting room floor.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_CUTCHARS_RIGHT_0_00	The Paladin also had a lot of overlap with the Knight, and was similarly axed. This is actually the class that Wrenna was originally going to be – the <LQ>fanatical and warlike enemy princess turned reluctant ally<RQ> seemed a perfect fit for someone with a sword. When this class ultimately got cut, I decided the enemy princess character was too good to not use somewhere, and the Ice Mage we all know and love was born.<N><N>While we're on the subject of classes that got changed, the Dragon was originally going to be the Dragon Rider. This absurdly overpowered unit would've been a dragon with an archer riding on its back. As is, Archers are one of the most overpowered classes in the game, so the Dragon Rider was scaled back to a plain old Dragon. I think Niru appreciates it.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_SANDWICH_LEFT_10	Boy, all of this behind-the-scenes writing has worked up my appetite. Are you guys hungry? I'm hungry. Let's address that issue.<N><N>You will need:<N><N>Sausage<N>Eggs<N>Bread<N>Tomatoes<N>Sauerkraut<N>Mustard<N>Yogurt (unsweetened and unflavored, because you're not a pansy)<N>Hot sauce (I prefer Louisiana style, but you can branch out into other things if you're some kind of social deviant or communist)
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_SANDWICH_RIGHT_0_00	Step 1:<N>Murder some animal (preferably an awesome animal, like a shark), grind up its corpse, and then stuff its corpse into its own intestinal lining. Alternatively, I suppose you could just go buy some sausage, but where's the fun in that?<N><N>Step 2:<N>Slice the sausage length-wise into thin strips.<N><N>Step 3:<N>Fry these sausage strips in a pan, making sure to get both sides nice and crispy, but not overdone.<N><N>Step 4:<N>Fry the eggs (as many as you think you can conceivably fit into a sandwich – I usually do 2, but don't let that stop you) in the left over fat from the sausage.<N><N>Step 5:<N>That bread is looking a little bit healthy compared to the rest of this. Fry that sucker in the remaining sausage grease! You can add more grease as needed. The
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_SANDWICH_LEFT_1_00	important thing is that your bread has been transformed from something that might remotely contain some health benefits into a crispy, grease-soaked impending heart attack. Remember, if a meal doesn't fill you with regret, you're doing it wrong.<N><N>Step 6:<N>Now for the sauce! Combine roughly equal parts mustard and yogurt in a bowl, or some other convenient dish, such as the hollowed out skulls of your enemies. Add hot sauce to taste and stir until everything is evenly mixed. If you still have leftover sausage grease in the pan, this is a good place to put it.<N><N>Step 7:<N>Time to assemble the sandwich! Liberally spread the sauce on both pieces of bread. Now stack all of your ingredients in no particular order: fried eggs, fried sausage strips, sauerkraut, sliced tomato, accidentally severed fingers, etc. The resulting monument to your awesomeness should be five or more inches tall.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_SANDWICH_RIGHT_1_00	Step 8:<N>Devour. Since all of our ingredients are dripping with grease, the sandwich tends to get soggy over time. Saving this guy isn't an option – eat him all now! No mercy! No prisoners! No leftovers! Democracy is at stake!<N><N>Step 9:<N>Regret.

He was eventually replaced by Zelemir, who had a far more interesting and complex set of motivations. However, I really liked the title and position of Lord Warden, so he got reincarnated as a suit of armor. Hey, at least his name is in the game!

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_MARKOS_NAME_LEFT_00	Markos' Name
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_MARKOS_NAME_LEFT_10	Markos' name actually comes from a very weird story a good friend of mine was told by one of his professors at St. Andrews. The professor, in his much younger days, had once gone on a tour of Europe. While in France, he visited one of the many medieval cathedrals available to the public. He was so entranced by the structure that he decided it would be a good idea to slip out of his tour group and hide so that, after everyone left and the cathedral closed, he could sneak around and look at everything without some pesky tour guide telling him where he could and couldn't go.<N><N>His plan worked, and as soon as the cathedral had shut down for the day, he slipped out of his hiding spot and began perusing. It was around this point that he noticed a pair of feet poking out from behind a tapestry. As it turned out, he was not the only one with a grand idea of secretly admiring medieval architecture. The person behind the tapestry turned out to be one of the young women from his same tour group, and the two of them began exploring the cathedral together.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_MARKOS_NAME_RIGHT_0_00	The two of them, distracted talking with each other, did not notice the arrival of a third-party until he asked them if they would like a <LQ>secret tour.<RQ> The man, who identified himself as Markos, had wild hair, an untrimmed beard, and long fingernails. He apparently made a regular habit of hiding in cathedrals until they closed and then exploring them at night, and was full of all kinds of behind-the-scenes information, even going so far as an impromptu performance on the church organ. It was around this point that he explained that many medieval Christian cathedrals were actually built on older pagan sites, and that oftentimes these pagan sites still existed below the later structure. This was actually his primary interest in cathedrals, as he was a druid. After some time spent exploring the back of the church, he successfully located an important looking hatch in the floor that opened into the catacomb that ran underneath the cathedral. Apparently seeing nothing wrong with following a strange man into a subterranean death chamber, the two tourists joined Markos underground, where they found the remnants of the pagan tomb that the church had been built on top of. After playing with the skulls a little bit, Markos bid them a good night, and everyone went their separate
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_MARKOS_NAME_LEFT_1_00	ways. The future professor and the young lady eventually got married. Markos, I like to believe, is living in a grotto under a cathedral somewhere, painting himself blue.<N><N>I liked the character so much, I decided I had to work the name Markos into something at some point.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_NAMES_LANG_LEFT_10	A lot of people have commented on the strange and unusual names the game generates for generic units that the player recruits in towns. These names were part of an effort to play up the differences between the three primary cultures: Ash, Quaid, and Nomad.<N><N>You'll notice that certain names crop up with certain physical characteristics. This is because the game has a list of physical characteristics for each civilization as well as a list of culture-specific names – when the player clicks to recruit a character, the game first randomly picks one of the three cultures for the recruit to come from and then picks a random name and physical characteristics from that culture's lists. For all three of you that are interested in such things, here's our old naming guide:
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_NAMES_LANG_LEFT_20	This here is our name bucket for the generic characters. The names are divided according to cultures. Feel free to add any that you think of. The general rule of thumb for names is as follows:
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_NAMES_LANG_RIGHT_0_00	Ash names: lots of Z's and V's, strong voiced continuous consonants and an overall Mediterranean flavor. Male names often end in -mon/man, -ir or -al, female names tend to end in -a or -i and sometimes <LQ>-vni<RQ>.

Ash has the most range in its appearances as it's intermarried the most with surrounding peoples.<N><N>Nomad names: Strong short syllable names with prominent ending non-continuous consonants. Female names tend to end in -a. K features prominently, as
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_NAMES_LANG_LEFT_1_00	well as sounds like <LQ>sk<RQ> and <LQ>st<RQ> and is the only language to use the sound J.<N><N>Nomad appearances:<N><N>Light brown skin<N>Green, blue, hazel eye color<N>Dark, light, and medium red-brown, sometimes black hair<N><N>    Overall, a kind of combination Romani/Afghan flavor. Having a small population that mostly marries within itself means that unusual genes, such as red hair and green eyes, tend to show up more often. Quaid names - lots of W's and L's, taking inspiration from Welsh and Hawaiian without being obviously one or the other (mostly because I was looking for letters that the Ash names weren't using prominently and L and W seemed to be it.) There's also a dash of Anglo-Saxon influence. Quaid uses the letter C rather than K, and often uses Y as a rounded I. Female names tend to end in -a and often <LQ>-nna.<RQ>

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_NOMADSPIRIT_LEFT_00	Nomad Spiritualism
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_NOMADSPIRIT_LEFT_10	Originally, the Nomads practiced a tribal based polytheism. Each tribe has its own gods (and among many tribes, each individual family has a subset of lesser household demi-gods) represented by idols. These gods are there to serve the tribe's interests, but must also be honored and served in return. Infighting and feuds are very common among the different tribes, as the constantly moving nomads often encroach on one another's turf, or take to rustling or raiding. The tribal gods serve as standards in these fights. For a tribe to lose its idols is the ultimate disgrace, and (unless the tribe can regain the idols through warfare) generally signals the end of that tribe's existence. A tribe without its gods is considered the lowest of the low, and shunned from trading and other meetings.<N><N>Each individual Nomad is also given a personal idol at birth, which is believed to be a servant of the tribe's gods. These servant spirits act as the individual’s guide and guardian through life. At a Nomad's death, the personal idol is buried with its owner in order to guarantee safe passage to Paradise. For a Nomad to lose
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_NOMADSPIRIT_RIGHT_0_00	their personal idol is a catastrophic event. Without its guardian spirit to lead the way, the Nomad's ghost is doomed to spend many ages looking for the path to Paradise.<N>    Prolonged exposure to the Ash Kingdom through trade, etc. has led to many of the tribes picking up the teachings of the Temple of Ash. Only a handful have been willing to fully abandon the old ways and completely join the Temple of Ash. The majority attempt to reconcile Ash's deity with their own. This muddling of the faith has created a lot of religious animosity from the Temple of Ash, adding to the general prejudice against the Nomads in the Ash Kingdom.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_STORYINSPIRE_LEFT_00	Story Inspirations
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_STORYINSPIRE_LEFT_10	A fellow English major once asked me what the literary inspirations for the story of Valley of the Forgotten were. For the other two of you that would be interested in these things, here's the top three things that were on my mind when I was writing:<N><N>The plague colony concept actually came from one of Rudyard Kipling's short stories, The Strange Ride of Morrowbie Jukes. I read it when I was 11 or 12 and the idea of a naturally shaped prison full of people that had <LQ>died<RQ> but recovered has stuck with me ever since. There's this very strong sense of a plague society that inspired some of the details in the Pit. (For instance, the fact that there are no horses. One of the first things that happens to Morrowbie is that his horse is killed and eaten - although he gets a share of the meat, so it's not all bad.)<N><N>Beyond that, a lot of the cultural flavor came from Byzantine historical records. Much of the Selini culture is based on the writings of the early desert fathers and
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_STORYINSPIRE_RIGHT_0_00	other early Eastern Christians.<N><N>And just to round out my history lit nerdom, a HUGE inspiration was Anglo-Saxon literature. I had just taken an Old English course when I started working on Defender's Quest and the language and culture were a gigantic inspiration for almost everything. The very pensive, elegiac tone seemed perfect for our kind of Medieval post-apocalypse setting. I highly recommend checking out The Ruin, if you're at all interested in that sort of thing; it's short and really encapsulates the kind of memento mori vibe of Anglo-Saxon literature.<N><N>Of course, there's a ton of stuff beyond that, but those three were probably the biggest influence on the setting. Well, those and a healthy dose of my favorite humor writers.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_BLOODMAD_LEFT_00	The Blood Mad Tribes
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_BLOODMAD_LEFT_10	The Nomads are actually the scattered remnants of an ancient civilization that was once part of Eztli-Tenoch's domain.  When Eztli-Tenoch was defeated most of them scattered, becoming the tribal, nomadic, polytheistic people that we are familiar with.  But some of them remained loyal to their defeated <LQ>god,<RQ> and, under the leadership of their mysterious Queen, grew into a shamanistic death cult dedicated to freeing Eztli-Tenoch from his prison.  These tribes surrounded the areas around Eztli's prison and set about breaking the blood seal in the only way they knew how: killing anyone they could get their hands on and painting the Great Stone with their blood, hoping that one day, they would manage to nab the right people.  People learned very quickly to avoid these areas, so the Blood Cults spread out, eventually into the territory of the Quaid Empire.  Obviously, having everyone on your highways ritualistically murdered isn't good for business, and certainly not good for the glory of the Cosmic Flame, so the Quaid Empire waged several wars of eradication against the cults (these are the ones that Wrenna refers to).
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_BLOODMAD_RIGHT_0_00	The cults are scattered but still a vague threat.  With the disappearance of their Queen centuries ago, the cults began to lose much of the reasoning behind their actions to complicated ritual. Most blood cults no longer orbit the actual Great Stone, and instead worship and sacrifice to smaller replicas of it.  However, with Eztli Tenoch being somewhat freed from his prison, he has reached out to his long lost children.  The shamans of the blood cults have heard his call, and are all leading their people back into the Pit, back to the Great Stone prison of their god.<N><N>The cultists maintain a poisonous diet (the same poisons Zelemir used on Ozimal) and a crazed mania that they believe to be filled with the spirit of their master. This poisonous diet allows them to transform themselves into revenant as needed. (Eztli-Tenoch's Right Hand is a shaman, or perhaps a group of shamans, that sacrifice themselves to become the hideously twisted instrument of their master's will).<N><N>Ketta's Tribe, the Geka, were massacred by the Blood Cultists when she was in her early tweens, which is why she has few tribal affiliations and why she would
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_BLOODMAD_LEFT_1_00	recognize them.<N><N>A big shout out to Lars for having the idea of Zelemir poisoning Ozimal.  Without that, the Blood-mad Tribes would never have occurred to me. (Originally, Ozimal was going to get turned into a revenant after Zelemir brutally shanked him to death on screen, but my Tarantino-esque bloodbath was vetoed in favor of some offscreen poisoning. Incidentally, Eyepatch Spear Guy, who has inexplicably attracted a small fan club, was also supposed to die in the melee.)<N>

All in all, the Imperial Cult is a fairly sophisticated monotheistic religion centered around fire worship.<N><N>The Imperial family is seen to be the chosen children of the Cosmic Flame. By bringing glory to the Quaid Empire the children earn the right to join their progenitor in the afterlife. The names of Imperial family members who have brought glory to the Empire in some way are recorded on a great stone wall in the Imperial Palace Complex – this functions as something of a ritualistic passport, signifying that they have the right to proceed to the afterlife. Those that have failed to bring glory to the Empire in some way during their lifetime are stricken from all historical records and their body is buried rather than cremated – an incredible dishonor, since cremation is the only way to join the Cosmic Flame.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_ASHTEMPLE_LEFT_00	The Temple of Ash
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_ASHTEMPLE_LEFT_10	The Temple of Ash is a monotheistic-based monarchical religious philosophy centered on balance and community. The world is seen as a great machine, functioning under the impetus of the Unmoved Mover, the creator who sets everything in motion. The role of the individual is to serve their purpose as a part of the greater machine, being in balance with their place in the world around them. Evil is seen as the failure to do so, or imbalance. (This place is dictated by social structure – great emphasis is placed on the chain of command or chain of being.) The center of the religion is the physical High Temple, which was once the school of the founding philosopher. Water is a key element in Temple rituals, the hydrological cycle being an example of an element in balance with its purpose in the great machine. After death, those who have fulfilled their purpose within the Earthly Machine are taken by the Unmoved Mover and made part of the Celestial Machine, the perfected version of the earth.<N>The Temple of Ash was founded by Selinadt, an exiled philosopher from one of the distant northern
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_ASHTEMPLE_RIGHT_0_00	independent city states. Banished from his homeland through the machinations of his political rivals, Selinadt wandered south, offering his services to various local rulers as an advisor. The King of Ash took him in after he defeated the king's wisemen in a riddle competition. After the conversion of the King of Ash, Selinadt's religious philosophy became widely popular throughout the region.<N><N>Since the King of Ash was the very first convert, each of his successors is seen as the caretaker of the Temple. The religion is practiced throughout the smaller neighboring kingdoms, but the High Temple at Ash is its center. For this reason, Ash is understood to be completely neutral in the wars that break out amongst its neighbors. In the few occasions that one of its neighbors has threatened it, the others have joined together against it to defend the Temple. This neutrality has allowed Ash to grow as a robust trading center, increasing its power and influence greatly. With the threat of the Quaid Empire, Ash's smaller neighboring kingdoms have united as a defacto federation, making Ash a sizable, albeit fractured empire.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_WARRIORMONK_LEFT_00	The 9th Branch of the Selini, House Militant, Defenders of Truth and Order
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_WARRIORMONK_LEFT_10	One of the major inspirations for the Ash religion – and especially the Selini like Bakal – was Eastern Christianity. As I was writing, I began to grow worried that the inspiration was a little too obvious. I desperately wanted to avoid cutting and pasting a real world religion wholesale into a fantasy universe, rather than creating a fantasy religion that felt like an organic part of its world.<N><N>I started looking for places where the Ash philosophy would deviate from my inspirations, how values would've evolved unique to this setting, etc. One of the things that immediately sprung out to me was pacifism. Eastern Christianity, while still allowing for some low level of necessary violence, has an incredibly pacifistic vibe. Clergy are banned from killing for any reason – even self-defense. (Self-defense is also frowned at among laymen.) Priests must be able to officiate a
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_WARRIORMONK_RIGHT_0_00	<LQ>bloodless sacrifice<RQ> when performing the Liturgy, the central focus of church life. (In fact, if a clergyman is involved in an accidental death – say a fatal car accident – he can never serve again.)<N> This seemed like an element that wouldn't necessarily work with the Selini philosophy that I created so far. It would be entirely conceivable, given the Ash religion's focus on order, that violence could actually be seen, at points of absolute necessity, as being a sacred duty. Sometimes, a broken part must be removed before it damages the rest of the machine. Who would be better equipped to carry out this task than warrior Selini? While the Selini would only view violence as a final resort, there would be no taboo against clergy or monks being its dispensers, as the religion I'd created had none of the <LQ>bloodless sacrifice<RQ> at its centerpiece that Eastern Christianity did.<N><N>And that's how we got warrior monks, which didn't even really figure in the game, but hey, they're there in the background. (There are many chapters of Selini, and only some of them are of the <LQ>House Militant.<RQ> Bakal is from a far more pacifistic chapter.) With warrior
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_WARRIORMONK_LEFT_1_00	monks, a caste-based chain of being governing its social order, a very Deist feeling Unmoved Mover, hydrological rituals, etc., I began to feel confident that the Ash Temple was becoming its own thing, rather than a rehash of real world religions.
