$ENTRY_JOURNAL_INTRO_TITLE
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_INTRO_LEFT_00	Jour 1 - Où suis-je ?
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_INTRO_LEFT_10	J'ai probablement perdu la tête, mais je vais tout de même essayer de noter les évènements qui se déroulent sous mes yeux. Le lecteur en tirera les conclusions qu'il voudra... Je ne fais que rendre compte des faits qui se sont produits tel que mon esprit enfiévré a pu les appréhender.<N>Je sais avec certitude que j'ai contracté la peste qui ravage notre belle capitale. Je sais également que, comme les autres victimes avant moi, j'ai été emmenée hors de la cité et jetée dans la Fosse. La série d'évènements qui a suivi s'est avérée si étrange et si terrifiante que je me demande encore si je rêve ou si je suis éveillée.<N>Lorsque la fièvre m'a emportée, je me suis retrouvée en un lieu obscur, en compagnie d'une autre victime.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_INTRO_RIGHT_00	Un glorieux trône a alors fait son apparition, et un homme tel que je n'en avais jamais vu y siégeait. Il m'a semblé entièrement doré. J'ai d'abord songé qu'il devait s'agir d'une statue, jusqu'à ce qu'il m'intime un ordre.<N>Sa voix aussi m'est apparue dorée, et elle semblait comme frissonner de la puissance du tonnerre. Je n'avais jamais entendu ce langage, ni lu quoi que ce soit s'en rapprochant dans la grande bibliothèque d'Ash, mais mon corps obéit aussitôt. Mes veines se contractèrent comme si mon sang allait jaillir de mon corps et accourir pour le rejoindre.<N>Mon cœur s'emballe encore rien que d'y repenser...<N>-[mcguffin_hero] Livbar
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_TITLE
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_LEFT_0_00	Nuit 1 - [berserker_hero]
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_LEFT_0_10	Lorsque j'en viens à vouloir parler de [berserker_hero], je me vois dans l'obligation d'abandonner le langage austère de la capitale afin d'adopter un jargon plus adapté au sujet.<N>[berserker_hero] est un crétin. J'irais même jusqu'à dire qu'il est l'incarnation même de la crétinerie. Il compense sa totale absence d'intelligence par une odeur particulièrement exacerbée. Si deux tas de fumier venaient à s'accoupler et à engendrer une descendance, leur progéniture putride tremblerait face à la puanteur qui se dégage des aisselles de [berserker_hero]. Les cadavres animés qui nous traquent exhalent un parfum exquis en comparaison.<N>Mais [berserker_hero] a bien plus à offrir que cette charmante particularité. Il possède également une personnalité que je ne saurais décrire autrement que comme relevant de la <LQ>débilité furieuse<RQ>.<N>Hier, il a passé quinze minutes à réprimander un caillou contre lequel il s'était cogné l'orteil. Et il n'a pas eu le dernier mot...
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_RIGHT_0_00	Je me sens vraiment privilégiée de devoir voyager en telle compagnie...
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_RIGHT_0_10	Jour 3 - Addendum
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_RIGHT_0_20	En toute équité, je me dois d'admettre qu'il est également l'homme le plus courageux que j'aie jamais vu. Son corps tout entier n'est qu'un tissage de cicatrices, même si ce fait perd un peu de son panache lorsque l'on prend en compte son refus systématique de porter le moindre vêtement ou la moindre pièce d'armure sur le torse. Il faut donc en arriver à la conclusion qu'il est à la fois un clown insupportable et un guerrier d'une redoutable efficacité, et que je me vois heureuse à contrecœur de l'avoir à mes côtés.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_RIGHT_0_30	<N><N>OOOOH MOI AUSSI ZE T'AIME !!! BIZOUU !!<N><N>JE DORS PAS JE FAIS JUSTE DES POMPES SUR LE DOS PARCE QUE C'EST BON POUR LES FESSIERS
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_RIGHT_0_40	<N><N>Apparemment, il sait aussi lire et écrire ! Mais où donc ce paumé assoiffé de sang a-t-il bien pu recevoir une telle éducation ?<N><N><N>P.S. : Piquez-moi encore une fois mon journal, et je vous réduis la cervelle en purée pendant votre sommeil.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_LEFT_1_00	Nuit 3 - Second addendum
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_LEFT_1_10	Alors, pour info, [berserker_hero] dort complètement nu. Toute tentative de vengeance se déroulera dorénavant en plein jour.<N>Et... effectivement, ses cicatrices ne s'arrêtent pas à la taille.<N><N>Je vous hais.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_SLAK_LEFT_1_20	<N><N>PARCE QUE TU CROIS QUE KHAN ET CHARISSA SE LAISSERONT FAIRE ?
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_PRISON_TITLE
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_PRISON_LEFT_0_00	Jour 3 - La prison
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_PRISON_LEFT_0_10	Il y a trois jours encore, je considérais la Fosse comme une prison. Je découvre aujourd'hui que même en Enfer, on peut toujours trouver pire.<N>L'homme qui nous retient prisonniers se nomme Ozimal Kaz. C'est un être cruel, mesquin et méprisable. Comment un compatriote a bien pu se pervertir à ce point, cela dépasse vraiment toute compréhension.<N>Je me serais attendu à cela venant des Quaidiens qui ont passé les deux dernières décennies à peaufiner leur cruauté contre les provinces de l'est. Même le plus impitoyable des chefs de clans nomades saurait mieux tempérer sa rage sanguinaire que ce dégénéré.<N>Et il vient de la capitale en plus, à en juger par son accent ! Ce monstre a grandi à l'ombre du Temple !
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_PRISON_RIGHT_0_00	Je suis assise ici avec ses autres prisonniers, mêlés sans discrimination... Des bandits, des brigands, des hommes, des femmes, des enfants, des Ashani, des Nomades, des Quaidiens... Tous attendent la mort entre les mains de cet homme.<N>Jour et nuit, nous entendons les grognements de son cheptel de Revenants, une cacophonie assourdissante ponctuée uniquement par les cris d'agonie de leurs dernières victimes. Et me voilà, incapable de faire quoi que ce soit ! Si au moins je me trouvais dans le colisée aux côtés de ces pauvres victimes, elles auraient au moins une chance de pouvoir se défendre !<N>Malgré sa bravade, Ozimal a semblé hésitant à l'idée de me faire <LQ>exécuter<RQ> une seconde fois. Peut-être Ozimal craint-il de perdre trop de ses Revenants ? Ils ne doivent pas être faciles à capturer et à entretenir, et il semble compter sur eux pour s'assurer le respect des vassaux de son misérable empire.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_PRISON_LEFT_1_00	Les paroles de ce mystérieux étranger continuent de me tourner dans la tête. Ozimal tiendrait à offrir une démonstration de mes talents à un <LQ>Homme en Rouge<RQ>. Qui est cet Homme en Rouge ? Et qui est ce mystérieux étranger qui semble à tout prix chercher à me sauver ? Quelle peut bien être mon importance ?<N>Au milieu de ce torrent de questions, je ne suis sûre que d'une chose : je n'ai jusqu'à présent fait usage de la violence que face à des êtres déjà morts, mais s'il m'arrivait de pouvoir mettre la main sur Ozimal, ma politique sur ce sujet pourrait bien changer de manière radicale...
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_HALFWAY_WORLD_TITLE
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_HALFWAY_WORLD_LEFT_0_00	Jour 4 - Le Monde à Mi-Chemin
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_HALFWAY_WORLD_LEFT_0_10	<N><LQ>Le Monde à Mi-Chemin<RQ>, c'est le mieux que mes faibles mots peuvent faire pour décrire le lieu dans lequel je me retrouve, et dans lequel j'attire les autres.<N>Quand j'étais jeune, j'ai failli me noyer en nageant dans les hauts-fonds du Kevel. C'est la seule expérience avec laquelle je puisse établir un parallèle. Cela provoque la même panique, la même sensation atroce de manquer d'air, tandis que mon cœur tente de toutes ses forces de s'arracher de ma poitrine. Mais cette fois, la main de mon père ne viendra pas me sauver. Il n'y a nulle rive à laquelle me raccrocher, mais seulement l'instant de la mort, étiré sur une éternité.<N>Le mécanisme qui me permet d'atteindre ce lieu dépasse ma compréhension. Tout ce que je sais, c'est que je m'y rends lorsque cela est nécessaire. Une fois sur place, je peux percevoir mes compagnons, pas par la vue, mais de la même façon que je suis consciente de mes membres sans avoir à les regarder.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_HALFWAY_WORLD_RIGHT_0_00	Je sais juste qu'ils sont là et je fais appel à eux avec toute la force dont je dispose. Cette force n'est guère immense, et j'use de ces pouvoirs avec la faiblesse d'un nourrisson qui cherche à déplacer son corps, mais cela suffit pour me sauver la vie. J'ai beau détester mes voyages dans ce terrifiant Monde à Mi-Chemin, cela vaut toujours mieux que le destin qui m'attendrait sans eux.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_KETTA_TITLE
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_KETTA_LEFT_0_00	Jour 5 - [ranger_hero]
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_KETTA_LEFT_0_10	Je crois que la chose que j'apprécie le plus chez [ranger_hero], c'est qu'elle empeste le bouc.<N>Je dois avouer que le choix est difficile face à ses stupéfiantes autres qualités, telles son immaturité chronique, sa tendance à tout commenter de manière dénigrante, son sarcasme pervers, ses penchants pour la cleptomanie, ses atroces habitudes alimentaires... Mais lorsque l'on partage une tente avec quelqu'un, c'est la puissante puanteur de bouc qui se démarque le plus rapidement.<N>Certaines nuits, une brise perfide vient souffloter depuis le côté des hommes de notre campement, en nous apportant sous ses aisselles poilues l'odeur caractéristique de [berserker_hero]. Le mélange résultant d'effluves ne peut être qualifié que d'ambroisien. C'est en général ces nuits-là que j'arrive le mieux à dormir, car mon corps semble préférer sombrer dans l'inconscience plutôt que de tenter d'interpréter les stimuli olfactifs auxquels il se trouve confronté.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_KETTA_RIGHT_0_00	Jour 8 - Addendum
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_KETTA_RIGHT_0_10	La nuit dernière [ranger_hero] m'a réveillée en hurlant dans la langue des Nomades. Son cri pourrait approximativement être traduit par <LQ>Femme à la morale plus que discutable, il est à moi !<RQ> Elle m'a ensuite arraché une grosse poignée de cheveux, l'a fourrée sous son oreiller, puis s'est aussitôt rendormie.<N>[ranger_hero] s'est excusée avec une insistance assez peu caractéristique de son personnage, allant même jusqu'à me montrer comment tresser du crin de cheval avec ma propre chevelure afin de masquer la zone dégarnie. Elle prétend ne pas se souvenir du rêve ayant pu provoquer une telle réaction. Mais je demeure sceptique...
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_AZRA_BY_SLAK_TITLE
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_AZRA_BY_SLAK_LEFT_0_00	Jour 10 - [mcguffin_hero] elle est trop naze !
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_AZRA_BY_SLAK_LEFT_0_10	<N>ALORS TU CROIS QUE C'EST PARCE QUE JE PEUX PAS LIRE TA LANGUE DE PROUT-PROUT-J'ME-LA-PÈTE QUE JE COMPRENDS PAS CE QUE T'AS ÉCRIT SUR MOI ?<N>EH BEN TU SAIS QUOI, PRINCESSE ? ON VA ÉCRIRE UNE NOTE DANS TON JOURNAL SUR TOI !<N>ALORS QUE DIRE DE [mcguffin_hero_up] ? QUE SON VISAGE EST TELLEMENT FIN QU'ON DIRAIT UN POISSON ? OU ALORS QUE SON COU IL EST GRAVE TROP TROP TROP LONG POUR SON CORPS ?<N>ET PUIS SES OREILLES, ON DIRAIT DEUX ABRICOTS TROP MÛRS ! ET SES CHEVEUX, ILS SONT MOCHES ET TOUT FILASSES ! ET SON HYGIÈNE PERSONNELLE EST LOIN D'ÊTRE AUSSI PARFAITE QU'ELLE LE PENSE.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_AZRA_BY_SLAK_RIGHT_0_00	ALORS, ÇA TE FAIT QUOI, PAUVRE NAZE ? MAINTENANT AU MOINS, JE SAIS QUI SONT MES VRAIS AMIS !<N><N>CORDIALEMENT,<N>[ranger_hero_up] QUI MANGE SON CACA<N>[berserker_hero_up] POURQUOI IL EST SI LONG À ÉCRIRE MON NOM ?
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_KARSK_BURNED_TITLE
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_KARSK_BURNED_LEFT_0_00	Nuit 7 - L'incendie de Karsk
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_KARSK_BURNED_LEFT_0_10	La mort ne m'est pas étrangère. Les neuf derniers mois de peste dans la capitale m'ont arraché le peu d'ignorance infantile que ma position privilégiée avait pu m'accorder sur le sujet. Mais jamais auparavant je n'avais assisté à si violente destruction. Même les bûchers de cadavres devant les Portes du Temple font pâle figure en comparaison.<N>Je ne trouve pas les mots...<N>Je comprends un peu mieux aujourd'hui la nature de notre ennemi.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_LAKSOS_TITLE
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_LAKSOS_LEFT_0_00	Jour 8 - Laksos
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_LAKSOS_LEFT_0_10	Nous avons été témoins d'un étrange rituel nomade à Laksos. Il s'agissait de fêter la naissance du nouvel enfant du chef des Karada, une tribu mineure mais encore fonctionnelle. Les parents ont présenté l'enfant devant deux grandes idoles de bois. Le chef a ensuite sorti un petit bloc de bois qu'il a déposé sur la tête de chaque idole, puis sur la tête de l'enfant. Il a alors pris un petit couteau, et a entrepris de graver le bloc, en laissant les copeaux tomber sur le visage de l'enfant. Une fois son travail terminé, il a accroché sa gravure à un tendon d'animal et l'a placée autour du cou de l'enfant.<N>Il y a eu un grand cri, et tous les membres de la tribu présents se sont soudain mis à danser, à chanter et à faire la fête à la manière typiquement grivoise des Nomades. Je n'ai jamais réussi à voir ce que le chef avait gravé.<N>J'ai plus tard demandé à [ranger_hero] quel était le sens de ce rituel, et elle m'a montré le petit renard en bois qu'elle porte autour du cou.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_LAKSOS_RIGHT_0_00	Elle m'a expliqué que son esprit est le serviteur de ses dieux tribaux, et qu'il lui a été offert à la naissance afin de lui servir de gardien et de guide, destiné à être enterré avec elle à sa mort afin de lui garantir l'accès au Paradis. Tout comme les dieux tribaux auraient été offerts par le Créateur à l'époque de la genèse de la tribu, les esprits personnels sont offerts à chaque membre de la tribu à leur naissance.<N>J'ai demandé à [ranger_hero] si la perte d'une idole personnelle était aussi catastrophique pour un individu que la perte des idoles tribales pour une tribu. Elle a souri et m'a montré sept idoles arrachées à ses ennemis, en m'expliquant que leurs âmes passeraient plusieurs âges à lutter pour trouver par eux-mêmes le Paradis. Je lui ai demandé si cela ne la dérangeait pas d'avoir infligé un tel sort à des compatriotes nomades, et elle m'a jeté un regard glacé, avant de me demander si cela ne me dérangeait pas d'avoir des oreilles trop grandes pour mon visage. Puis elle est partie en entonnant un chant parlant de manger des langues de chèvres...<N>Je pense qu'un jour, je vais lui défoncer le crâne à l'aide d'un caillou.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_OZIMAL_DEAD_TITLE
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_OZIMAL_DEAD_LEFT_0_00	Jour 10 - La mort d'Ozimal
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_OZIMAL_DEAD_LEFT_0_10	Je pensais que la mort d'Ozimal m'apporterait une certaine forme de satisfaction. Je me trompais.<N>Il n'était rien de plus qu'un autre cadavre traînassant à l'œil vitreux, soumis à la volonté de notre ennemi. Un pion, même avant sa mort... Le monde a été débarrassé d'un homme cruel et vicieux. Ici, dans la Fosse, y aura-t-il seulement quelqu'un pour s'en apercevoir ?
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MONASTERY_TITLE
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MONASTERY_LEFT_0_00	Nuit 10 - Le Monastère
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MONASTERY_LEFT_0_10	Je suppose qu'il était stupide de ma part d'espérer que quoi que ce soit dans la Fosse puisse ressembler à chez moi, mais j'ai tout de même été choquée de découvrir ici le Monastère de Selini. Il s'agit d'une structure menaçante et imposante, qui tient plus de la forteresse que du temple. Je comprends bien la nécessité de telles précautions, mais il m'est difficile de concilier cela avec la Fontaine du Temple auprès de laquelle j'ai grandi, et où même les gardes sont équipés d'armes émoussées, de peur de semer le chaos et la destruction sur le lieu de naissance de l'harmonie.<N>Qu'il était rassurant de plonger les mains dans la Fontaine, en sachant que je me trouvais au même endroit que tant de croyants avant moi, et ce en remontant jusqu'à Selinadt lui-même ! Là, je n'étais qu'une humble servante, uniquement séparée des rois et des prophètes par le temps.<N><LQ>Tout comme l'eau s'élève sous forme de brume au-dessus de la vallée, tombe sous forme de neige sur les
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MONASTERY_RIGHT_0_00	montagnes, s'engouffre dans les rivières jusqu'à la mer, chaque homme également, né de la même essence, doit servir les différents rôles de son époque et de son poste, afin d'atteindre l'harmonie au sein de la Machine Céleste.<RQ><N>Je m'interroge à présent sur le rôle que je suis censée jouer en ce lieu terrible et dépourvu de lois, où l'harmonie et la sagesse ne semblent plus être que de lointaines chimères...<N>On peut trouver un certain réconfort, je suppose, dans ce temple-forteresse. Ces moines n'y remplissent-ils pas leur rôle ? Ces murailles imposantes et ces défenses de temps de guerre ne sont rien d'autre que les adaptations qui permettent à l'esprit de Selinadt d'être servi ici, en ce lieu d'anarchie. Comme l'a dit lui-même le grand homme, <LQ>La vérité reste la vérité, quelle que soit la langue dans laquelle elle est écrite<RQ>. Ces défenses ne sont rien d'autre que le langage de la Fosse. La vérité qui s'y trouve demeure vraie.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_BAKAL_TITLE
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_BAKAL_LEFT_0_00	Jour 11 - L'Ancien [healer_hero]
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_BAKAL_LEFT_0_10	Le Vénérable Ancien [healer_hero] est une oasis de raison au sein de cet antre du chaos. Même si la vitesse de notre fuite ne nous accorde guère de temps pour la conversation, les quelques mots que j'ai pu échanger avec lui m'ont grandement réconforté.<N>J'aimerais pouvoir lui en offrir autant en retour. Il semble qu'une angoisse interne le tourmente. Je l'aperçois de temps en temps qui rôde derrière son visage placide de moine. Il est clair qu'il a autrefois été soldat : ses cicatrices, sa posture et ses manières trahissent une vie de guerrier.<N>J'ai découvert au Monastère qu'il n'est en fait pas membre du clergé, même si tous ceux qui le connaissent l'appellent toute de même Vénérable Ancien. En fait, il n'occupe aucune position d'autorité, du moins pas officiellement. Pourtant, ses pairs viennent régulièrement lui demander conseil et lui obéissent comme s'il était leur supérieur. Le Seigneur Abbot lui-même m'est apparu comme n'étant rien d'autre qu'un proche disciple...
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_BAKAL_RIGHT_0_00	L'aventure actuelle semble autant agiter qu'inspirer [healer_hero], comme si son âme était dans la balance. Je comprends à présent pourquoi [ranger_hero] le craint. De temps à autre, j'aperçois une détermination dans ses yeux qui pourrait rivaliser avec celle de notre poursuivant. J'espère juste que [healer_hero] sera un jour capable de trouver pour lui-même la paix qu'il apporte aux autres.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_WRENNA_TITLE
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_WRENNA_LEFT_0_00	Jour 13 - [mage_hero_fu]
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_WRENNA_LEFT_0_10	La description de la royauté de Quaid par Polimon n'est pas exagérée. [mage_hero] est effectivement <LQ>plus pâle que la lune et deux fois plus distante.<RQ>. Et si je peux me permettre de compléter un classique, j'ajouterais <LQ>quatre fois plus changeante<RQ>. Je n'ai jamais vu quelqu'un basculer entre diverses phases de la folie avec une telle célérité. Même [berserker_hero] demeure cohérent dans sa propre folie. [mage_hero] est un océan furieux. Un instant, elle paraît d'une intelligence diabolique, et l'instant d'après d'une naïveté désespérante. Souvent, ses actions donnent l'impression de n'être qu'une ruse habilement jouée, mais dès que j'ai l'impression de voir mes doutes se confirmer, elle se laisse emporter par une dangereuse démence infantile à laquelle aucun acteur rationnel n'oserait s'exposer.<N>Parfois j'ai l'impression de voir transparaître derrière cette folie une jeune fille qui me ressemble : effrayée, seule et soudainement dotée de pouvoirs terrifiants. Je me demande si elle est elle-même capable de le percevoir...
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_NOMADS_TITLE
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_NOMADS_LEFT_0_00	Jour 14 - Les Nomades
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_NOMADS_LEFT_0_10	J'ai trouvé très intéressant de pouvoir observer par moi-même les tribus nomades, les populations indigènes qui occupent les steppes et les montagnes situées entre les cités d'Ash et l'Empire de Quaid. Plus d'une centaine de tribus différentes ont été référencées par Kantimal Polimon au cours de sa grande excursion dans l'est, même si je soupçonne que la majeure partie d'entre-elles aient été perdues dans les ravages de la guerre. Ici, dans la Fosse, j'ai rencontré les membres de vingt-sept* tribus différentes. Il est impossible de dire combien d'autres ont survécu dans le monde extérieur.<N>Comme leur nom le suggère, les tribus ont adopté un mode de vie nomade, élevant des chèvres et des chevaux à travers les steppes. Bien peu d'éléments de ce mode de vie ont pu être repris au sein de la Fosse, où la protection nécessite des défenses permanentes.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_NOMADS_LEFT_0_20	<N>* Moins de la moitié fonctionnent encore réellement en tant que tribus.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_NOMADS_RIGHT_0_00	Les tribus fonctionnelles créent des villages tels que Karsk, et s'arrangent pour survivre avec quelques chèvres et une agriculture rudimentaire.<N>Les Nomades sans attaches (ceux dont les tribus ont été détruites ou dispersées) trouvent refuge dans les installations plus cosmopolites telles que Laksos, ou deviennent des rangers, chargés de transmettre des messages et de protéger le commerce entre les villages de la Fosse.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DREAM1_TITLE
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DREAM1_LEFT_0_00	Jour 15 - Un rêve étrange
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DREAM1_LEFT_0_10	Cela faisait bien longtemps que je n'avais pas rêvé de quoi que ce soit. Les sensations horrifiques du Monde à Mi-Chemin semblent tellement dominer mon esprit, que même dans mon sommeil, je ne perçois rien d'autre que leurs échos. Pourtant, la nuit dernière, pour la première fois depuis les visions enfiévrées de la maladie, j'ai rêvé.<N>C'était un rêve si intense qu'il est parvenu à chasser de mon esprit les horreurs de tout ce dont j'ai été témoin. En fait, toutes les expériences de mes 23 années m'ont semblé s'estomper en sa présence.<N>Je me tenais sur un balcon surélevé. Je n'étais pas moi-même. Mes bras étaient sombres et musclés, couverts d'étranges symboles et ornés de bracelets d'or. Ma robe était couverte d'une telle multitude de joyaux que la richesse d'une nation tout entière n'aurait pas suffit à égaler ne serait-ce que la parure de son ourlet.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DREAM1_RIGHT_0_00	La lune était basse dans le ciel, gigantesque et d'un rouge incandescent. J'aurais pu tendre le bras et la caresser de la pointe de mes doigts.<N>Une voix m'appela, et je me tournais. Il y avait un homme à côté de moi sur le balcon. Il était grand, plus grand que n'importe quel homme que j'aie jamais croisé. Sa chevelure et sa barbe étaient d'un noir de jais, longues et ornées d'anneaux d'or. Sa présence semblait rendre le monde terne et insignifiant.<N>Il me regarda avec des yeux d'onyx, et je compris que nous ne faisions qu'un. Je décrochais la lune de feu, et je la partageais avec lui...<N>Je me suis réveillée tremblante, la main agrippant mon cœur comme si je tenais encore cette lune rouge. J'ai été submergée par une telle nostalgie que j'en ai fondu en larmes. En cet instant précis, j'aurais pu faire n'importe quoi pour regagner ce rêve.<N>
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DESERT_FORTRESS_TITLE
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DESERT_FORTRESS_LEFT_0_00	Jour 17 - Joyau-du-Désert
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DESERT_FORTRESS_LEFT_0_10	Je m'étais souvent demandé à quoi pouvaient ressembler les demeures de nos grands ennemis de l'est. La guerre nous était toujours apparue comme une terreur intangible dans la capitale, transmise uniquement par les rapports funestes des pertes journalières et les lamentations des nombreux vétérans mutilés mendiant dans les rues. Après une vie de peur informe, la vision d'une authentique cité quaidienne est une étrange expérience. Je suis frappée par la beauté et par l'ingéniosité de sa conception, mais plus que tout le reste, je suis choquée par son côté familier. J'y vois tous les détails qui marquent la vie d'une cité : les pavés usés des rues très fréquentées, le monument agrémenté du vandalisme des jeunes générations, les étals du marché arrangés tout comme ils le seraient dans n'importe quelle autre cité.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DESERT_FORTRESS_RIGHT_0_00	Je n'ai aucun mal à imaginer mon propre père assis au coin de la rue, riant, jurant et échangeant des histoires avec les autres hommes de la cité.<N>Pourtant, les habitants de ce lieu ont détruit Terna et exterminé toute sa population... Hommes, femmes et enfants.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MARKOS_TITLE
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MARKOS_LEFT_0_00	Jour 18 - [knight_hero]
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MARKOS_LEFT_0_10	Me suis-je donc à ce point habituée à vivre en compagnie de forcenés qui ne croient plus en la raison ?<N>[knight_hero] est courtois, intelligent, globalement bien intentionné, parfois même amusant... Et il est même convaincu des vertus de l'hygiène personnelle ! Mais on dirait que cela ne suffit encore pas à me convaincre.<N>Il doit bien y avoir un problème chez lui ! Un tic, une lubie, une quelconque irrationalité.

Pour être plus précis, je ne pourrai garantir votre sécurité, ou du moins la sécurité de la globalité de cette entreprise, tant que nous persisterons à nous encombrer de [mage_hero_fu] Lan Laxmi.<N>Vous pouvez persister à m'assurer qu'elle n'est <LQ>pas si mauvaise que cela<RQ> et que la Guerre Quaidienne est terminée, mais je peux vous certifier qu'elle n'est clairement pas terminée pour elle !

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_LETTER_MARKOS_2_LEFT_0_10	Cher [knight_hero_fu],<N>En réponse à votre lettre, je souhaiterais vous faire remarquer trois choses.<N>Tout d'abord, pourquoi m'écrire une lettre alors qu'il vous suffirait de vous rapprocher de trois mètres pour venir me parler en personne ? Y a-t-il un problème avec mon hygiène personnelle ? Les autres se moquent-ils de moi en secret à ce propos ?<N>Ensuite, pourriez-vous arrêter de m'appeler milady ?<N>Enfin, laissez tranquille [mage_hero], sinon je... Je ne sais pas trop.

Enfin bref, ce que je veux dire, c'est que [mage_hero_fu] a beaucoup souffert, et que vous feriez mieux de vous en prendre à quelqu'un qui le mérite, comme [berserker_hero_up], qui semble s'imaginer que je n'ai pas remarqué qu'il est en train de lire par-dessus mon épaule, en dépit du fait qu'il ne soit qu'un crétin congénital qui pue la

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_NIRU_LEFT_0_00	Nuit 22 - [dragon_hero]
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_NIRU_LEFT_0_10	J'ai eu bien des occasions d'entendre parler des dragons. Ma cousine a passé toute son enfance littéralement obsédée par ces créatures, et elle dévorait avidement toutes les légendes que je pouvais lui ramener de la bibliothèque, des postulats scientifiques de Polimon jusqu'aux contes des Nomades. Ces histoires m'étaient ensuite régurgitées d'une manière typiquement enfantine : à l'envers, embrouillées, et sans prendre le temps de respirer.<N>En dépit de la qualité de ces comptes-rendus, une bonne partie des informations ont tout de même réussi à se trouver une place dans un recoin de mon esprit. Et aujourd'hui, alors que je tiens compagnie à un dragon en chair et en os, ces leçons de l'enfance me reviennent par vagues.<N>Au fil de cette aventure, j'ai appris à m'attendre à ce que mes idées préconçues soient particulièrement inexactes face à la nature réelle de mes sujets d'étude. Cependant, dans ce cas précis, mon éducation s'avère tout à fait juste : [dragon_hero] n'est qu'un lézard
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_NIRU_RIGHT_0_00	surdimensionné, gras, cupide, égoïste et hautain, qui n'aspire qu'à l'accumulation de butin et s'enivre d'illusions de divinité.<N><N>Une créature aussi puissante constitue effectivement un danger très réel. Elle n'aurait aucun scrupule à dévorer les membres de notre compagnie, habituée qu'elle est à tuer tout ce qui l'importune un tant soit peu, ainsi qu'à traiter tout ce qui est <LQ>mortel<RQ> comme inférieur.<N>La supériorité est souvent la championne de l'ignorance. [dragon_hero] a en sa possession un <LQ>gobelet à taille de dragon<RQ> qu'elle chérit tout particulièrement. Si elle avait un tant soit peu connaissance de la langue écrite d'Ash, elle saurait que l'inscription qui orne l'artefact en question indique qu'il s'agit en fait du <LQ>Pot de Chambre du Seigneur Redamal<RQ>. Lorsqu'elle en arrive à vraiment m'exaspérer avec ses grands airs, il me suffit de songer avec jubilation à l'usage qu'elle fait de ce <LQ>gobelet<RQ>...

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_NIRU_LEFT_1_10	En dépit de son ambivalence générale eut égard à tout ce qui n'est pas elle-même, [dragon_hero] semble être une mère particulièrement attentionnée.<N>Lorsque je la vois se faire du souci à propos du bien-être de sa couvée, je ne peux m'empêcher de songer à ma propre mère. Il est assez étrange d'avoir de telles pensées à propos d'un monstre gigantesque qui menace quotidiennement de vous immoler ou de vous dévorer, mais c'est néanmoins mon ressenti.<N>Je suis conscience qu'une telle marque de sympathie pourrait causer ma perte, mais j'arrive à peine à concevoir le sentiment de perte qu'elle doit éprouver envers ses jeunes que les Revenants ont emportés. Il semblerait que cette grande tragédie de notre époque affecte même les plus puissants et les plus distants d'entre nous...

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DREAM2_LEFT_0_00	Jour 25 - Le second rêve
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DREAM2_LEFT_0_10	J'ai encore fait ce rêve, la nuit dernière. Sa forme était différente, mais j'ai bien senti qu'il s'agissait du même rêve... Ou du moins, j'étais la même rêveuse.<N>Je me tenais dans un grand hall. Ses murs se dressaient si loin au-dessus de moi que le plafond était fait de nuages. Chacun des murs brillait comme de l'or et était serti de merveilleux joyaux à perte de vue. Entre les mains, je tenais une coupe ornée de somptueuses gravures, sombre comme le vin et froide au toucher.<N>Malgré toutes les merveilles qui m'entouraient, je chérissais cette coupe plus que tout le reste, et je la transportais avec délicatesse, de peur de perdre la moindre goutte de son contenu.<N>Soudain, le hall s'assombrit, et une meute crasseuse surgit de nulle part. Je fus frappée, malmenée, et la coupe me fut arrachée des mains. Je hurlais et j'extirpais une longue dague de mes robes, frappant et fendant jusqu'à ce que le hall soit noirci de leur sang.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DREAM2_RIGHT_0_00	En dépit de ses pertes, la cohue me submergea, et finit par m'expulser du hall, jusqu'à une antichambre lugubre. J'eus beau lutter, la horde riposta jusqu'à ce que je sois totalement brisée. Alors que je m'effondrais, la meute se précipita dans le hall, avide de pouvoir arracher les joyaux étincelants des murs. Je restais allongée un temps, me croyant morte. Lorsqu'enfin je pus me remettre sur pieds, le hall était désert. Les murs avaient été brisés et démantelés, et tout était recouvert de suie et de crasse. J'eus beau chercher, la coupe demeura introuvable. J'errais dans le hall pendant une éternité, appelant de toutes mes forces, mais j'étais seule. On m'avait pris la coupe.<N>Je m'assis dans les ruines, et je pleurais.

Je suis consciente d'avoir fait ce que la raison dictait, mais j'ai tout de même fait couler le sang de la lignée royale d'Ash. Il avait dévié de sa route au point de mettre en danger la totalité de l'ordre des choses. Néanmoins, ce sentiment me hante encore. J'ai véritablement tué un homme de chair et de sang, pour la première fois.<N>[mage_hero] oscille entre l'allégresse et la colère, maudissant son nom comme si elle pouvait le tuer à nouveau.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DREAM3_LEFT_0_10	J'ai encore rêvé la nuit dernière.<N>Je me trouvais en un lieu désolé. Devant moi se dressait un gigantesque cristal d'au moins 30 mètres de haut. J'étais en larmes. Les larmes dégoulinaient sur tout mon corps, sur mon or et mes amulettes, avant de toucher le sol. Elles s'insinuaient à travers la terre poudreuse jusqu'au cristal, et c'est alors que je réalisais qu'il ne s'agissait plus de larmes, mais de ruisselets de sang.<N>À mes pieds gisaient de nombreux cadavres, hommes, femmes et enfants. Mes mains étaient couvertes de leurs entrailles. Je me retournais, et je vis une armée derrière moi, maculée de sang tout comme moi. Les soldats attendaient que je parle.<N>Je levais au ciel mes bras écarlates, et je criais d'une voix aussi puissante que le tonnerre.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_DREAM3_RIGHT_0_00	L'armée reprit mon cri. Il s'agissait d'un mot que je n'avais jamais entendu, mais j'en connus aussitôt le sens. Ce mot signifiait <LQ>sang<RQ>. Le cri s'amplifia, au point de faire trembler la terre.

Le trône d'Eztli-Tenoch...<N>Cet acte m'a tout d'abord mise profondément mal à l'aise. Mais après tout, pourquoi ? Quelle forme de respect doit-on au mal ? Cet homme doré n'est rien d'autre qu'un petit tyran aspirant à devenir un dieu. Il y a quelque chose de fondamentalement pathétique dans ce genre de mal. Cela relève de la même folie des grandeurs que chez ceux qui aspirent à devenir de grands hommes. Il suffit de regarder cet endroit : un palais entier conçu dans le seul but de renforcer une image créée par lui-même. Regardez-moi, semble-t-il hurler, je suis le vrai visage du pouvoir ! Eztli-Tenoch le dieu, impuissant dans sa cage de cristal...<N>Pourtant, une autre partie de moi parvient à le comprendre. Une partie qui a déjà parcouru ces couloirs, qui a connu la divinité... J'ai siégé à ses côtés, en prenant de haut la populace. J'ai ressenti notre aspiration divine.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_EPILOGUE_LEFT_0_10	Quelle étrange sensation que de pouvoir rester immobile en disant <LQ>Il n'y a rien qui cherche à me tuer en ce moment<RQ>. Je ne suis pas encore vraiment sûre d'y croire. Je m'attends encore à ce que des moutons enragés surgissent au détour d'un couloir de la bibliothèque et se mettent à me charger. Pour l'instant, je n'ai croisé qu'une souris, dont je me suis rapidement débarrassée avec l'aide de l'imposant Traité de Polimon sur le Bon Fonctionnement des Plantes.<N>[knight_hero] passe très régulièrement à la bibliothèque. Le mois dernier, il a demandé à consulter quasiment tous les traités militaires que j'ai pu lui trouver, mais ayant épuisé tous les sujets sensibles, il s'intéresse désormais à tout ce que je peux lui dénicher sur une étagère. Il me semble que le dernier ouvrage qu'il a consulté était un manuel sur l'élevage des furets qu'il a, j'en suis persuadée, choisi totalement au hasard. Il a ensuite passé toute la durée de sa visite à discuter avec moi plutôt qu'à lire. Je me doutais bien qu'il devait être un peu zinzin...
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_EPILOGUE_RIGHT_0_00	Enfin bon, il est tout de même agréable d'avoir quelqu'un à qui parler pendant que je restocke les étagères.

La peste et les Revenants ayant disparu, l'Empire de Quaid va devenir un territoire très attirant pour tous les aspirants seigneurs de guerre et les rois-bandits, sans parler des royaumes du Nord. Cependant, s'il y a bien quelqu'un qui pourrait affronter le monde entier et remporter la victoire le sourire aux lèvres, c'est [mage_hero].<N>[healer_hero] a regagné son monastère.

La cité se reconstruit, et avec elle renaît la vie urbaine trépidante qui ne me fait plus vraiment vibrer.<N>Mes yeux n'aspirent qu'à contempler des territoires vierges et l'horizon distant. Peut-être reste-t-il encore un peu d'aventurière en moi, finalement ? Je ne doute pas une seconde que [knight_hero] et ses gardes seraient prêts à m'accompagner, ce qui éliminerait quasiment tout danger, et que je devrais parvenir à le contraindre de chanter à nouveau, ce qui éliminerait toute forme d'ennui.<N>Je pensais que [dragon_hero] s'était définitivement retirée du monde des <LQ>mortels<RQ>, mais je n'en suis plus aussi sûre... La semaine dernière, plusieurs livres reliés d'or ont été déposés sur le toit de la bibliothèque. Il faudrait vraiment être très doué pour l'escalade pour atteindre une telle hauteur en transportant un tel poids. Je me plais à penser que notre mystérieuse bienfaitrice était capable de voler, ce qui pourrait signifier qu'une certaine déesse auto-proclamée a dû trouver un compagnon pour entraîner ses enfants.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_EPILOGUE_LEFT_2_00	C'est là une pensée heureuse, et je pense m'y accrocher.<N>Je trouve étrange de discuter avec des personnes étrangères à notre petit groupe. Les rares à qui j'ai commencé à me confier se sont surtout moquées de mes récits, quand elles n'avaient pas déjà été abreuvées des versions déformées et largement exagérées répandues par les réfugiés.<N>Ce matin, deux enfants m'ont arrêtée dans la rue pour me supplier de <LQ>faire fondre la tronche<RQ> d'une petite brute qui les tourmentait. On n'en sort pas... Un simple regard furieux a suffi à le faire détaler chez lui à toute vitesse pour changer son pantalon souillé, ce qui a finalement été encore plus apprécié par mon auditoire que n'aurait pu l'être un visage fondu. D'autres personnes se sont précipitées vers moi dans la rue pour me demander de soigner leurs cors au pied, de bénir leurs ânes, de maudire leurs voisins, et ainsi de suite...<N>C'est peut-être pour cela que je suis si heureuse lorsque [knight_hero] me rend visite à la bibliothèque.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_ACTQUOTES_LEFT_10	Some of my favorite things to write were the little bits of flavor text that opened each act of the story. They really let me experiment with other voices and give the player little glimpses into the larger world that the story was set in. When it came to start act seven, I actually came up with three different quotes and then picked a favorite to use in the game. Here are the two that didn't make the cut:<N><N><LQ>When faced with a decision, the selfish man thinks on a multitude of outcomes, weighing which option will yield him the best return.  The true man thinks only of which will serve the Flame.<RQ><N>- From the Book of Seven Wisdoms on the Path of the Blade<N><N><LQ>I look at the faces of our Northern mercenaries and I see the despair of a man who has gambled and lost.  We shall all die, but I shall die for my home, for my family, for the King and the Temple.  They shall die for a paltry sum of gold.<RQ><N>- Unknown defender, Siege of Karedon's Pass
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_ACTQUOTES_LEFT_1_00	introductory bit of flavor text was taken from Thief: The Dark Projekt, one of my favorite games of all time. I don't think I've ever played anything else that had such a lavishly imagined, nuanced, and hauntingly beautiful setting. Master thief Garrett silently slipping through the shadows of The City, amidst grinding industrial machines and occult horrors, passing unseen through the warring factions of magic and reason is an image that will stay with me for the rest of my life. Sometimes I cry when I think about it. Although, that may have more to do with all the paint I ate as a kid...
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_ACTQUOTES_RIGHT_0_00	The one that finally made it into the game is this:<N><N><LQ>It is said that men fear death.  In my experience, what men truly fear is the uncertainty of death.  In all that ordeal, when death was the only conceivable outcome, I was possessed by an unassailable calm I have never felt before or since.  It was only when the chance of survival appeared that I felt the true grip of terror.<RQ><N>- from the Memoirs of Gedemon Dalavbar, Master of Archers, being a History of his Adventures and Exploits in Service to the Ash King<N><N>This quote was highly inspired by a passage from Shadow of the Torturer, by Gene Wolfe, which I began reading as I was finishing work on Defender's Quest. (I didn't realize this inspiration until long after I finish writing the piece.) It's an incredibly strange, often disturbing book, which I would not recommend to younger readers. However, for mature audiences who are interested in taking a journey to a new and alien place, the book captures a sense of otherness in its world and values rarely found in modern fiction.<N><N>Speaking of inspirations, the idea of each act having an

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_ASHTEMPLE_LEFT_00	The Temple of Ash
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_ASHTEMPLE_LEFT_10	The Temple of Ash is a monotheistic-based monarchical religious philosophy centered on balance and community. The world is seen as a great machine, functioning under the impetus of the Unmoved Mover, the creator who sets everything in motion. The role of the individual is to serve their purpose as a part of the greater machine, being in balance with their place in the world around them. Evil is seen as the failure to do so, or imbalance. (This place is dictated by social structure – great emphasis is placed on the chain of command or chain of being.) The center of the religion is the physical High Temple, which was once the school of the founding philosopher. Water is a key element in Temple rituals, the hydrological cycle being an example of an element in balance with its purpose in the great machine. After death, those who have fulfilled their purpose within the Earthly Machine are taken by the Unmoved Mover and made part of the Celestial Machine, the perfected version of the earth.<N>The Temple of Ash was founded by Selinadt, an exiled philosopher from one of the distant northern

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_ASHTEMPLE_RIGHT_0_00	independent city states. Banished from his homeland through the machinations of his political rivals, Selinadt wandered south, offering his services to various local rulers as an advisor. The King of Ash took him in after he defeated the king's wisemen in a riddle competition. After the conversion of the King of Ash, Selinadt's religious philosophy became widely popular throughout the region.<N><N>Since the King of Ash was the very first convert, each of his successors is seen as the caretaker of the Temple. The religion is practiced throughout the smaller neighboring kingdoms, but the High Temple at Ash is its center. For this reason, Ash is understood to be completely neutral in the wars that break out amongst its neighbors. In the few occasions that one of its neighbors has threatened it, the others have joined together against it to defend the Temple. This neutrality has allowed Ash to grow as a robust trading center, increasing its power and influence greatly. With the threat of the Quaid Empire, Ash's smaller neighboring kingdoms have united as a defacto federation, making Ash a sizable, albeit fractured empire.

Because… if there was danger of you getting attacked… you'd want to have your weapons where you could actually reach them.)<N><N>Next time you see some movie where some super cool dude keeps his sword on his back (or better yet, two swords), watch closely when he draws it. You'll notice the film always conveniently cuts – he gets a couple inches out of the scabbard (with the appropriate metal-on-metal shing noise that by the way would only ever happened if something was scratching the crap out of your blade) and then magically it cuts to him with the sword all the way out.

This spring also wears on the blade, so if you find still extant sabers of this variety, they will oftentimes have significant blade wear where the spring has rubbed against them every single time they're drawn. So yes, that cool shing noise does come from something, however it's very limited, and still bad for the swords long-term.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_BLOODMAD_LEFT_00	The Blood Mad Tribes
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_BLOODMAD_LEFT_10	The Nomads are actually the scattered remnants of an ancient civilization that was once part of Eztli-Tenoch's domain.  When Eztli-Tenoch was defeated most of them scattered, becoming the tribal, nomadic, polytheistic people that we are familiar with.  But some of them remained loyal to their defeated <LQ>god,<RQ> and, under the leadership of their mysterious Queen, grew into a shamanistic death cult dedicated to freeing Eztli-Tenoch from his prison.  These tribes surrounded the areas around Eztli's prison and set about breaking the blood seal in the only way they knew how: killing anyone they could get their hands on and painting the Great Stone with their blood, hoping that one day, they would manage to nab the right people.  People learned very quickly to avoid these areas, so the Blood Cults spread out, eventually into the territory of the Quaid Empire.  Obviously, having everyone on your highways ritualistically murdered isn't good for business, and certainly not good for the glory of the Cosmic Flame, so the Quaid Empire waged several wars of eradication against the cults (these are the ones that Wrenna refers to).

Incidentally, Eyepatch Spear Guy, who has inexplicably attracted a small fan club, was also supposed to die in the melee.)<N>
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_BLOODMAD_RIGHT_0_00	The cults are scattered but still a vague threat.  With the disappearance of their Queen centuries ago, the cults began to lose much of the reasoning behind their actions to complicated ritual. Most blood cults no longer orbit the actual Great Stone, and instead worship and sacrifice to smaller replicas of it.  However, with Eztli Tenoch being somewhat freed from his prison, he has reached out to his long lost children.  The shamans of the blood cults have heard his call, and are all leading their people back into the Pit, back to the Great Stone prison of their god.<N><N>The cultists maintain a poisonous diet (the same poisons Zelemir used on Ozimal) and a crazed mania that they believe to be filled with the spirit of their master. This poisonous diet allows them to transform themselves into revenant as needed. (Eztli-Tenoch's Right Hand is a shaman, or perhaps a group of shamans, that sacrifice themselves to become the hideously twisted instrument of their master's will).<N><N>Ketta's Tribe, the Geka, were massacred by the Blood Cultists when she was in her early tweens, which is why she has few tribal affiliations and why she would

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_BOSSREVENANT_LEFT_10	For those of you who are curious about our boss revenant, here's an explanation from one of our internal design documents:<N><N>Some revenant may be more powerful than others, depending on how much spiritual focus the wizard is giving that particular pawn. Furthermore, some <LQ>shells<RQ> are more conducive than others. For instance, a powerful necromancer could inhabit the corpses of squirrels. And while an army of zombie squirrels would be pretty hilarious, squirrels do not have the same depth of spiritual existence that humans do – less of the their being is in the shadow realm. Basically, the bigger a void left by a soul, the more room there is for the wizard to fill it with his own spiritual focus (ideally as soon as the thing dies – as a corpse rots, so does its spiritual dimensions, so the older a corpse gets, the less it can do). This carries over to people as well. Not everyone has as much room for the wizard to work in. Shallow vessels can only carry a small amount of his spirit, and won't allow him to do things that require more energy

The Kallikantzaroi are just jackasses like that, I guess. Anyways, the only time they stop trying to kill the world is on Christmas, which arrives just as they are about to saw all the way through the World Tree. Starting on Christmas, they get to come up to the surface and run around peeing in people's beer, stealing candy from babies, sticking your toothbrush in the toilet, and generally being ass-clowns of the highest caliber. All their fun ends on the day of

Kallikantzaroi can only count as high as the number two – since three, being the number of the Trinity, is a holy number, if one of the Kallikantzaroi says it out loud, they will immediately die. So if you stick a colander on your porch, those punk ass Kallikantzaroi will stay up all night trying to count all of the holes in it but always losing count after the number two. Then you just get up first thing in the morning, bust out your trusty .45, cap those tragically math-obsessed fools in their collective keister, put the bodies down the garbage disposal, and enjoy urine-free beer for the rest of the holiday season.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_CUTCHARS_LEFT_10	We were originally going to have an even larger party roster, but had to cut characters in order to keep things at a more manageable size. Among the guys that ended up on the chopping block were the Paladin and the Protector.<N><N>The Protector was going to be a heavily defensive <LQ>tank<RQ> type unit who carried a massive shield. His whole shtick was that he could shield, not just himself, but also nearby allies. So when a defender next to him would have normally gotten hit, the Defender would zap in and block the shot with his shield. Story wise, if I remember correctly, the Protector was going to be part of an elite fanatical military unit from Ash that believed it had a moral obligation to defend any land on which one of its members had shed blood. Elements of the Protector were recycled for Markos the Knight, although the more fanatical <LQ>Our blood! The blood of patriots!<RQ> aspects were left on the cutting room floor.

This absurdly overpowered unit would've been a dragon with an archer riding on its back.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_MARKOS_NAME_LEFT_10	Markos' name actually comes from a very weird story a good friend of mine was told by one of his professors at St. Andrews. The professor, in his much younger days, had once gone on a tour of Europe. While in France, he visited one of the many medieval cathedrals available to the public. He was so entranced by the structure that he decided it would be a good idea to slip out of his tour group and hide so that, after everyone left and the cathedral closed, he could sneak around and look at everything without some pesky tour guide telling him where he could and couldn't go.<N><N>His plan worked, and as soon as the cathedral and shut down for the day, he slipped out of his hiding spot and began perusing. It was around this point that he noticed a pair of feet poking out from behind a tapestry. As it turned out, he was not the only one with a grand idea of secretly admiring medieval architecture. The person behind the tapestry turned out to be one of the young women from his same tour group, and the two of them began exploring the cathedral together.

He apparently made a regular habit of hiding in cathedrals until they closed and then exploring them at night, and was full of all kinds of behind-the-scenes information, even going so far as an impromptu performance on the church organ. It was around this point that he explained that many medieval Christian cathedrals were actually built on older pagan sites, and that oftentimes these pagan sites still existed below the later structure. This was actually his primary interest in cathedrals, as he was a druid. After some time spent exploring the back of the church, he successfully located an important looking hatch in the floor that opened into the catacomb that ran underneath the cathedral. Apparently seeing nothing wrong with following a strange man into a subterranean death chamber, the two tourists joined Markos underground, where they found the remnants of the pagan tomb that the church had been built on top of.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_NAMES_LANG_LEFT_00	Names and Languages
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_NAMES_LANG_LEFT_10	A lot of people have commented on the strange and unusual names the game generates for generic units that the player recruits in towns. These names were part of an effort to play up the differences between the three primary cultures: Ash, Quaid, and Nomad.<N><N>You'll notice that certain names crop up with certain physical characteristics. This is because the game has a list of physical characteristics for each civilization as well as a list of culture-specific names – when the player clicks to recruit a character, the game first randomly picks one of the three cultures for the recruit to come from and then picks a random name and physical characteristics from that culture's lists. For all three of you that are interested in such things, here's our old naming guide:

Having a small population that mostly marries within itself means that unusual genes, such as red hair and green eyes, tend to show up more often. Quaid names - lots of W's and L's, taking inspiration from Welsh and Hawaiian without being obviously one or the other (mostly because I was looking for letters that the Ash names weren't using prominently and L and W seemed to be it.) There's also a dash of Anglo-Saxon influence. Quaid uses the letter C rather than K, and often uses Y as a rounded I. Female names tend to end in -a and often <LQ>-nna.<RQ>

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_NOMADSPIRIT_LEFT_00	Nomad Spiritualism
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_NOMADSPIRIT_LEFT_10	Originally, the Nomads practiced a tribal based polytheism. Each tribe has it's own gods (and among many tribes, each individual family has a subset of lesser household demi-gods) represented by idols. These gods are there to serve the tribe's interests, but must also be honored and served in return. Infighting and feuds are very common among the different tribes, as the constantly moving nomads often encroach on one another's turf, or take to rustling or raiding. The tribal gods serve as standards in these fights. For a tribe to lose it's idols is the ultimate disgrace, and (unless the tribe can regain the idols through warfare) generally signals the end of that tribe's existence. A tribe without it's gods is considered the lowest of the low, and shunned from trading and other meetings.<N><N>Each individual Nomad is also given a personal idol at birth, which is believed to be a servant of the tribe's gods. These servant spirits act as the individual’s guide and guardian through life. At a Nomad's death, the personal idol is buried with its owner in order to guarantee safe passage to Paradise. For a Nomad to lose

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_NOMADSPIRIT_RIGHT_0_00	their personal idol is a catastrophic event. Without its guardian spirit to lead the way, the Nomad's ghost is doomed to spend many ages looking for the path to Paradise.<N>    Prolonged exposure to the Ash Kingdom through trade, etc. has led to many of the tribes picking up the teachings of the Temple of Ash. Only a handful have been willing to fully abandon the old ways and completely join the Temple of Ash. The majority attempt to reconcile Ash's deity with their own. This muddling of the faith has created a lot of religious animosity from the Temple of Ash, adding to the general prejudice against the Nomads in the Ash Kingdom.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_STORYINSPIRE_LEFT_00	Story Inspirations
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_STORYINSPIRE_LEFT_10	A fellow English major once asked me what the literary inspirations for the story of Valley of the Forgotten were. For the other two of you that would be interested in these things, here's the top three things that were on my mind when I was writing:<N><N>The plague colony concept actually came from one of Rudyard Kipling's short stories, The Strange Ride of Morrowbie Jukes. I read it when I was 11 or 12 and the idea of a naturally shaped prison full of people that had <LQ>died<RQ> but recovered has stuck with me ever since. There's this very strong sense of a plague society that inspired some of the details in the Pit. (For instance, the fact that there are no horses. One of the first things that happens to Morrowbie is that his horse is killed and eaten - although he gets a share of the meat, so it's not all bad.)<N><N>Beyond that, a lot of the cultural flavor came from Byzantine historical records. Much of the Selini culture is based on the writings of the early desert fathers and
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_STORYINSPIRE_LEFT_1_00
$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_STORYINSPIRE_RIGHT_0_00	other early Eastern Christians.<N><N>And just to round out my history lit nerdom, a HUGE inspiration was Anglo-Saxon literature. I had just taken an Old English course when I started working on Defender's Quest and the language and culture were a gigantic inspiration for almost everything. The very pensive, elegiac tone seemed perfect for our kind of Medieval post-apocalypse setting. I highly recommend checking out The Ruin, if you're at all interested in that sort of thing; it's short and really encapsulates the kind of memento mori vibe of Anglo-Saxon literature.<N><N>Of course, there's a ton of stuff beyond that, but those three were probably the biggest influence on the setting. Well, those and a healthy dose of my favorite humor writers.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL2_WARRIORMONK_LEFT_10	One of the major inspirations for the Ash religion – and especially the Selini like Bakal – was Eastern Christianity. As I was writing, I began to grow worried that the inspiration was a little too obvious. I desperately wanted to avoid cutting and pasting a real world religion wholesale into a fantasy universe, rather than creating a fantasy religion that felt like an organic part of its world.<N><N>I started looking for places where the Ash philosophy would deviate from my inspirations, how values would've evolved unique to this setting, etc. One of the things that immediately sprung out to me was pacifism. Eastern Christianity, while still allowing for some low level of necessary violence, has an incredibly pacifistic vibe. Clergy are banned from killing for any reason – even self-defense. (Self-defense is also frowned at among laymen.) Priests must be able to officiate a

(In fact, if a clergyman is involved in an accidental death – say a fatal car accident – he can never serve again.)<N> This seemed like an element that wouldn't necessarily work with the Selini philosophy that I created so far. It would be entirely conceivable, given the Ash religion's focus on order, that violence could actually be seen, at points of absolute necessity, as being a sacred duty. Sometimes, a broken part must be removed before it damages the rest of the machine. Who would be better equipped to carry out this task than warrior Selini? While the Selini would only view violence as a final resort, there would be no taboo against clergy or monks being its dispensers, as the religion I'd created had none of the <LQ>bloodless sacrifice<RQ> at its centerpiece that Eastern Christianity did.<N><N>And that's how we got warrior monks, which didn't even really figure in the game, but hey, they're there in the background.

Still holding my wrist, he took his knife and cut open the seam of the gambeson. Inside were a row of sharp needles. He continued cutting down the length of the sleeve to reveal more hidden barbs. All told, there were 32 of them, each tipped with poison, sewn into the outer layer of fabric where one might grab an attacker's arm.<N><N>As [knight_hero] continued his dissection, we discovered a thin pocket, stitched into the sleeve's wrist. Inside was a piece of parchment, rolled on itself. The illustration was not unlike the many illuminated manuscripts I handled back in the great Library of Ash, though foreign in the style. Despite significant damage, the image is still discernible: a slender woman sits on a throne. Her face is obscured by scorch marks, but long white hair runs down her shoulders and mingles with the jewels around her neck. At her feet sit two boys, dark-skinned and golden eyed. The woman rests her hands on the boys' heads. Their hair, like hers, is white.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_BLACKROBES_LEFT_0_10	[berserker_hero] has begun gathering the bloodsoaked robes of the fallen cultists for some project I prefer to know nothing of. It is strange to see the faces behind the masks, though they be twisted with their sudden transformation into revenant.

At one time, they would not have seemed out of place in the company of Nomads.<N><N>[mage_hero] is strangely joyed to have faced them, as if to fight the same enemy as her grandfather is to share in that hero's glory. The cultists, as she explained to me, were once the greatest threat to the Quaid Empire. United under the banner of a central matriarchy, the madmen were a kingdom in their own right, launching full-scale invasions to feed their never-ending appetite for sacrificial victims. Generations of Quaid fought them to a standstill, but it was not until [mage_hero_pos] grandfather that the Empire was able to go on the offensive.

The once powerful institution of matriarch had given way to a disorganized ruling class of high priests, each eager for his own power more than the good of the whole.

His few remaining guards had fled at the sight of our victory over their trained revenant, leaving the petty tyrant's chambers ripe for plunder. We procured as much as we could carry from his private larder, acquiring sausages, oil, and a significant quantity of cheeses to help us on our journey.

First it was the Quaid, architects of all the pain and misery I ever saw throughout my early life. While I read daily about the evil in my own heart, I secretly told myself that none of it could compare to the evil of the armies of the East, murderers and ravagers, men who had made themselves animals.

But the enemy was not content with the massacre of the garrison and turned their fury on the populace, disregarding age, youth, and sex in their senseless rage. By the day's end, thirty thousand men, women, and children lay slaughtered. Terna was nothing but ashes, populated by scarcely enough souls to recount the horror of what was done there.<N><N>For this reason is my every tenth prisoner burned alive. Until thirty thousand die by my hand, the immolations shall continue, for the edification of the prisoners and the achievement of true balance.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_GIBBERISH_LEFT_0_10	[knight_hero] woke me today. We had paused briefly to consume some small scraps of food, and I, weary from the long march, reclined in the cool stone archway we had just passed. Sleep, which has troubled me somewhat of late, came easily for once. My slumber cannot have lasted more than a few moments. Presently I opened my eyes to find [knight_hero] standing in front of me. He informed me that we had to press on, and, as he took the path in front of me, added that I had been speaking gibberish in my sleep.<N><N>Though it may have been mere nonsense to his ears, I felt meaning clinging to the corners of my half-sleeping mind. I drew out my journal and, in a rush that dared not stop and examine lest I should lose my quarry, jotted out what I remembered.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_JOURNEYS_LEFT_0_10	I am growing more skilled at walking and writing simultaneously.

Hence, this journal.<N><N>I had never fancied myself a traveler; all of my 23 years were occupied in the capitol and its surrounding locales. My childish wanderlust was sated by the written word.<N><N>In those idle moments of daydream when I did entertain fantasies of travel, I always thought it would be to our Western brethren. How interesting it would be to follow the Temple pilgrims on their homeward journey, men of the mountains, dark as Nomads, and beyond them men darker still, people of the sea, all united by the way of Selinadt. Seven kingdoms bound together by the truth of the Fountain.<N><N>If I sought the fear and excitement of heathen lands, I

There, my eager eyes could journey to the North, into the realm of the Carcassians, who we speak of as a single people, but are so many and varied that Gozal the Elder claimed any three of their city states would feel as different as Ash, Quaid, and Nomad. And beyond them the heathen of the heathens, the fantastical terrors of unknown shores, and the great mountain on which Kezmir inscribed the legend <LQ>Here there live the eaters of the moon.<RQ><N><N>What a dismal comparison my current journey makes, here on the doorstep of Ash, where all things familiar turn grim and terrible.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MANUSCRIPT_LEFT_0_10	<N>Cleared of all threat, the river outside of [healer_hero_pos] Chapter House has yielded a great bounty. ([berserker_hero], having finished with the revenant, spent the remainder of the day savagely depopulating the water of all other occupants.) While the resultant feast of broiled fish has most pleasantly filled my belly, it is one of the revenant corpses that fills my mind.<N><N>Of all that vile host we purged from the river, one carcass stood out from the rest. He had once been a herald of no small importance, judging by the quality of his dress, and the strange pattern and cut of his attire leads me to believe he hailed from one of the many Northern city states. While the rest of his accoutrements were far too damp-rotted to be of any use, he bore on his belt a watertight capsule of waxed leather. Inside, I discovered a still legible piece of parchment.<N><N>The contents validate my theory as to the man's origin. The text appears to be written in one of the many
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MANUSCRIPT_LEFT_1_00	leads me to suspect that this Nomad loan may be a proper name, possibly that of the manuscript's author, or perhaps the intended recipient.<N><N>Such is the extent of the discoveries I can make on my own. I may call on the aid of [healer_hero], who I am told holds a not inconsiderable level of ability in several Carcassian tongues.<N><N>ADDENDUM:<N><N>[healer_hero] does indeed possess the skill with which his fellow monks credited him. Despite the obscurity of the dialect, he was able, within only a few moments, to present me with a translation of the text's opening line:<N><N><LQ>Return to me, my beloved,<RQ> Further progress was considerably slower, and the resulting interpretation far from complete, but a strange picture has begun to emerge. The second line, <LQ>And to our children who are weeping,<RQ> indicates that the relationship between the writer and recipient was far deeper than a tawdry love affair.

It is a great comfort to me, even if it is also a great selfishness, to shut out the dark and bloody world which has become my life, and dedicate my energies wholeheartedly to the deciphering of some mysterious manuscript. If I close my eyes, I can almost feel myself back at the Library.<N><N>On my own, I have already been able to tease out several details, despite my ignorance of the language. I see, repeated several times, what appears to be a group of glyphs borrowed from the Nomad (a tongue which, at the risk of sounding boastful of my linguistic prowess, I shall admit to possessing a meager command of). It roughly translates to <LQ>ornamented woman,<RQ> or <LQ>Queen<RQ> (as I have seen it used in some texts), though perhaps <LQ>Woman of Many Symbols<RQ> would be closer to the literal meaning. The arrangement of the text around it
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MANUSCRIPT_RIGHT_1_00	From there, [healer_hero] tells me the language becomes increasingly difficult, and the few words he can understand seem such gibberish that he begins to doubt his accuracy. <LQ>What voice have I to challenge the one you now hear?<RQ> is the only other complete statement [healer_hero] is able to produce. The remainder of the text is a mystery we cannot pierce, save for a word which [healer_hero] says could mean either <LQ>gray<RQ> or <LQ>dust,<RQ> several repetitions of the phrase <LQ>you return to blood,<RQ> and many uses of the proper name I discovered previously.<N><N>Hearing me say the name out loud, [ranger_hero] has corrected my understanding of the Nomad loan. In the Northeast (where it seems this manuscript originates), the word for <LQ>symbol<RQ> has somewhat different connotations. According to [ranger_hero], a more accurate translation of the phrase would be <LQ>Woman of Many Mystic Charms.<RQ> The magical quality of the woman has, sadly, not granted me any new insights into the text. All I can say is that she had, at the very least, bewitched the author's heart. Judging by the wealth apparent in his messenger, this Carcassian King (as I would guess) spared no expense in

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MARKOSSTORY_LEFT_0_10	To Lady [mcguffin_hero] Livbar from [knight_hero] Kashantir, Knight of the Host of Ash.<N><N>You asked me, some time ago, how it was I anticipated the danger hidden within the strange armor you discovered. As you correctly guessed, I do have a previous experience with an assassin similarly outfitted. While I rebuffed your curiosity at the time, I have had some days to think on the matter, and have decided to relate to you my experience.<N><N>This is not a story I divulge frequently, nor, if I can help it, think on.<N><N>It was a grim time. The plague would not come for another two years. In those days, it seemed, nothing could stop the Quaid war machine. The Eastern provinces were stained red with the blood of their people, and incursions had begun to break into even the heart of Ash.

I had never seen any living thing so still. He did not speak, but occasionally, and with no provocation, he would laugh, and when he did the teeth that showed were all midnight black. The men called him the Shade Drinker.<N><N>Our orders were simple: deliver the Carcassian to the enemy camp, and provide whatever assistance he might require in his task.<N><N>The weather was against us. A thick fog had descended during the night, and in the predawn darkness we

Its guard was already dead.<N><N>Still holding my arm, the Carcassian entered the general's tent, drawing me after him. The general lay on a cot at the far end, surrounded by maps and scrolls and other accoutrements of command. Even lying down, I could tell he was a giant of a man, head and shoulders taller than I, and larger still than the slender Carcassian. Releasing me, the Shade Drinker crept to the general's foot. From some unseen sheath, he produced a small knife. He held it over his head for a moment, and it seemed to me time hung still. With a sudden jerk, he brought the knife down into the sleeping Quaidman.<N><N>The general sprang to his feet with a gasp. The knife still protruding from his ribs, he seized the Carcassian by the shoulders and hurled the smaller man across the tent. Drawing his sword from where it lay next to his cot, the Quaidman closed the distance between them with a single step. Fearing for my companion's life, I drew my sword and made ready to strike the advancing giant. My blow was checked by the strange sound of the Carcassian's laughter.

In the worn leather of the grip were carved strange characters. I looked up, and he was flanked by another four figures, clad and black-toothed smiling as he was. As one, they stepped backwards, into the mist and out of view.<N><N>Our commander choked to death in his sleep several weeks later, and the story spread throughout all the men that it was the Shade Drinker come back for his payment.<N><N>Years later, I met another soldier educated in some of the languages of the Carcassians. I showed him the knife, and he translated the characters for me. They said <LQ>Many lives to you, boy.<RQ>
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MARKOSSTORY_RIGHT_0_00	My father was dead. My brothers were dead. I came forward, the eldest living male of the house of Kashantir, to fight. There were many like me, boys of noble birth who had spent their whole lives training but never yet spilled mansblood. Below us were boys younger still: commoners, peddlers, farmer's sons fresh from the fields, all summoned to give their lives for Ash.<N><N>It was a sign of the kingdom's desperation, I suppose, that such a delicate task was given to us.<N><N>Spies had brought news of a Quaid general making camp with his advance party, the foremost point of the fire worshipers' claw sunk into the heart of Ash. His guards were few, the spies said, the time to strike was now.<N><N>Our commander was ill prepared for such an action. The bulk of his troops were untested recruits, my age or younger, and his Nomad auxiliaries were deserting at a steady pace. He had no reserves, no veterans to call on, and scarcely enough gold to field more than a handful of mercenaries.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MARKOSSTORY_RIGHT_1_00	quickly lost our way. Unwilling to call out, lest we betray ourselves to the enemy, our small number was quickly separated. With rising dread, I realized I was alone in the mist.<N><N>I wandered for a great time, stumbling in my blindness, terrified that every step would discover me to the enemy. Presently I came upon a form in the mist. He was a Quaid guard, dead, red with his own blood. He had no eyelids.<N><N>I had stumbled into the enemy camp, and I was not alone.<N><N>Ahead of me, crouched between two tents, was another figure. I could not make out the man's features, but I reasoned by his stance that he too was an intruder. Creeping to the man's location, I reached out to touch his shoulder and alert him of my presence. Without turning, he caught my arm.<N><N>Cracking a black-toothed grin so wide it seemed to split his face in half, the Shade Drinker pointed at the tent in
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_MARKOSSTORY_RIGHT_2_00	He lay, sprawled where the general had tossed him, black teeth shining in grotesque mirth. The giant's demeanor changed. His sword fell from his trembling hands. Like a crumbling tower, he collapsed, his great body wracked by convulsions.<N><N>With a wordless cry, the Carcassian was on him, straddling the dying man as he pried out his knife. I watched in the fear as the assassin reached out both his hands and began to make ablutions with the Quaidman's last ragged breaths, scooping them up and over his head and pouring them out as if they were water.<N><N>As the general's wheezing turned to silence, the Carcassian ended his ritual. He turned and saw me where I stood, still holding my undelivered blow. He made another black-toothed grin at me and peeled back the cloth on his shoulder to reveal a row of barbs, loaded with the venom that had taken his victim's life.<N><N>Taking my wrist again, he led me out of the tent, to the edge of the camp.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_THE_FOX_LEFT_0_10	When I was a child, I once found a dying fox in the gardens that surrounded the Royal Library. How this wild creature had reached the heart of the city is a mystery to me, but his presence had caused the silent patrons to forsake their meditations and attack the small beast with stones and fallen branches, their anger turning the gardens around them into an armory. Broken and bloodied, the fox had dragged himself into an alcove to die. I could hear his small whimpering breaths from the path where I walked with my mother. I darted away and slipped into the doorway of the alcove. The fox froze at my appearance. The whimpering stopped in his red mouth. He met me with a silence containing more pain and anger than any warning growl ever could. His eyes stayed locked with mine as my mother pulled me back to the path and out of view.<N><N>I am reminded of that moment as I sit here waiting in vain for sleep to take me. I braced myself for a violent tempest, but [mage_hero] has walked these ruined halls the whole day long in dispassion, seemingly unaffected by the signs of death all around her.

I presented it to [healer_hero], but he pronounced that the remaining script had no pertinence to our quest. He seemed eager to remove it from his gaze.<N><N>I do not know why I did what I did.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_THE_FOX_RIGHT_0_10	My dream has left me unsure of my own motivations.
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_THE_FOX_RIGHT_0_20	I would like to say that I spoke to her out of a desire for friendship, or even simply idle curiosity, but I fear my actions were born of a hunger to hurt the only available target for all of my fear and hate. All my life the Quaid have been the invisible source of all anguish. Perhaps I merely wanted to see one suffer the pain of loss they so frequently inflicted upon us. Perhaps her calmness irritated me. Or perhaps I envied her strength and
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_THE_FOX_RIGHT_1_00	They are obviously the words of one of the Quaid defenders, doomed to die in the siege. His eloquence in the face of his death – indeed the death of everything he knew – left me without words. As I stood pondering the ruined elegy, I was shocked to find the bottom of the page stained with tears.<N><N>I opened the flap to [mage_hero_pos] tent but stopped before I could say anything. She was curled in the far end, her flaxen hair hanging in limp strands over her face. Her fox eyes, incarnadined with sorrows I can never know, met mine. It was the same silence as all those years ago, heavy with more pain and anger than any words could ever hold.<N><N>I left immediately, but the image still haunts me. This time, I threw the stones.

$ENTRY_JOURNAL_WRENNASTORY_LEFT_0_00	Day 26 – [mage_hero_pos] Story
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_WRENNASTORY_LEFT_0_10	I continue to discover great chasms between the world around me, as it stands in actuality, and the carved and colored interpretation of it that sits in my mind. It seems I have spent most of my life judging, not things themselves, but the intellectual fabrications I have created of them.<N><N>As we sat around the campfire tonight, [mage_hero] began to tell a story. I braced myself, expecting a journey into the grim and macabre: casual killings at a young age, or the violent fervor of the zealot.<N><N>Instead, she told a story about her youngest sister.<N><N>This child, seven years [mage_hero_pos] junior, envied the older girl's mobility. So great was this feeling of inadequacy that she took to – at unexpected moments – clambering onto [mage_hero_pos] back, and so parasitically assuming the height and athleticism she coveted. [mage_hero] soon became adept at removing this unwanted passenger, to the young girl's great frustration. This
$ENTRY_JOURNAL_WRENNASTORY_RIGHT_0_00	continued for some time, with the youngest repeatedly attaching herself to the oldest, only to be immediately unseated. One day [mage_hero] woke to find her sister perched at the head of her bed, laboriously covering herself with the contents of a pilfered jar of honey, hoping, with this makeshift adhesive in place, to permanently bond herself to her chosen beast of burden.<N><N>[mage_hero] ended the story and looked at me with an expectant, girlish grin. It was some moments before I realized she was waiting for my laughter.<N><N>What a strange and new reaction it was for me. The [mage_hero] of my mind elicited only fear or pity. Her portrait was either that of a grim and terrible warlord, even in her personable moments expressing a humor drenched in blood, voiced with the laughter of the fanatic, or else the pained and broken child, a helpless object on which to pour out all my self-righteous pity.<N><N>How grave my misconceptions are, which seek to condense the human soul to a simple object, pertinent only in its relation to me.
