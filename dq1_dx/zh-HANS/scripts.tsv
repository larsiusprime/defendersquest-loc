$LINE_3_2_OUTRO_260_CHAR	$MAG
$LINE_3_2_OUTRO_260_TEXT	I tried to flee, but could not move. Each moment the whispers grew louder until they drowned my screams.
$LINE_3_2_OUTRO_270_CHAR	$MAG
$LINE_3_2_OUTRO_270_TEXT	Then suddenly it all vanished.  I was here in the hospital, being cared for by the monks.
$LINE_3_2_OUTRO_280_CHAR	$MAG
$LINE_3_2_OUTRO_280_TEXT	But though I had escaped hell, I found I had brought a piece of it with me.
$LINE_3_2_OUTRO_290_CHAR	$MAG
$LINE_3_2_OUTRO_290_TEXT	This... ice in my heart... I have never felt the same.
$LINE_3_2_OUTRO_300_CHAR	$MAG
$LINE_3_2_OUTRO_300_TEXT	Each day I hope the Flame will make me whole again... and each day the curse continues.
$LINE_3_2_OUTRO_310_CHAR	$MAG

$LINE_HOSPITAL_INTRO_100_CHAR	$HEA
$LINE_HOSPITAL_INTRO_100_TEXT	Principalities burned. Entire territories slaughtered.
$LINE_HOSPITAL_INTRO_110_CHAR	$HEA
$LINE_HOSPITAL_INTRO_110_TEXT	We were on the verge of annihilation.
$LINE_HOSPITAL_INTRO_120_CHAR	$HEA

$LINE_HOSPITAL_INTRO_160_CHAR	$HEA
$LINE_HOSPITAL_INTRO_160_TEXT	The location of an ancient power, lost in ages long past.
$LINE_HOSPITAL_INTRO_170_CHAR	$HEA
$LINE_HOSPITAL_INTRO_170_TEXT	With the enemy at our gates, he formed a plan.
$LINE_HOSPITAL_INTRO_180_CHAR	$HEA
$LINE_HOSPITAL_INTRO_180_TEXT	A dark plan, born of desperation.
$LINE_HOSPITAL_INTRO_190_CHAR	$HEA

$LINE_HOSPITAL_OUTRO_70_CHAR	$HEA
$LINE_HOSPITAL_OUTRO_70_TEXT	Yes, there is a risk that he may anticipate our movements.
