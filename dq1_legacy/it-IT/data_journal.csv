I would expect this from the Quaid, who have spent the last two decades refining their cruelty on the eastern provinces.  Even the most ruthless of Nomad chieftains  would temper his blood-rage more than this degenerate.

The chief produced a small block of wood which he laid on the head of each idol and then on the head of the child. He then took out a small knife and carved the block, allowing the shavings to fall over the infant's face. Having finished his work, he strung the carving on an animal sinew and placed it around the child's neck.

Just as the tribal gods were given out by the Creator at the time of the tribe's genesis, so the personal spirits were given out to each member of the tribe at their birth. 
I asked <ranger_hero> if losing a personal idol was as catastrophic for the individual as losing tribal idols is for the tribe. She smiled and showed me seven idols she had taken from enemies, explaining that now their souls would spend many ages struggling to find paradise on their own. I asked if it bothered her to have done this to her fellow nomads and she gave me a glassy look, asked if it bothered me that my ears were way too big for my face and then walked off singing about eating goats' tongues.

I discovered at the monastery that he is not actually of the priesthood, though all that know him call him Reverend Elder anyways.

They were a childhood obsession of my cousin's, and she hungrily devoured any legend I could find at the library, from Polimon's scientific postulations to Nomad folktales.  These stories were then regurgitated to me in typical childish fashion: backwards and scrambled and without pauses for breath.  Despite the quality of the lectures, a good deal of the material lodged in recesses of my mind.  Now that I keep company with a flesh and blood dragon, I find these childish lessons flooding back.
Over the course of this adventure I have learned to expect my preconceptions to be largely inaccurate when confronted with the living subject of my study.

Superiority is often the champion of ignorance.  <dragon_hero> has in her possession a treasured <LQ>dragon sized goblet<RQ>.

I was standing in a great hall.  Its walls stretched up above me, towering so high that the ceiling was made of clouds.  Each wall was golden-bright and adorned with wondrous jewels as far as my eye could see.  In my hands was a goblet, carved from some lustrous material, wine-dark and cold to the touch.  
Despite all the wonders that surrounded me, I treasured the goblet above all things, carrying it so as to not spill a single drop from its lip. Suddenly the hall darkened and a filthy rabble surged into it. They struck me and abused me and tore the goblet from my hands. I screamed and drew a sharp dagger from my robes, slashing and striking out at them until the hall was dark with blood.",,,,

I lay for a long time, believing myself to have died. When I finally could climb to my feet, the hall was empty. The walls had been torn down and smashed, and everything was covered in soot and filth. I looked, but the goblet was nowhere. I wandered the hall for an eternity, crying out, but I was alone. The goblet had been taken from me. 
I sat down in the ruin and wept.",,,,

I was standing in a desolate place.  Before me stood a gigantic crystal, rising up a hundred feet into the sky.  I was weeping.  The tears ran down my body, across my gold and charms, and out onto the ground.  They snaked across the dusty earth towards the crystal and I realized that they were no longer tears but rivulets of blood.  
There was a host of corpses at my feet - men, women, and children.  My hands were caked with their gore.  I turned and saw an army behind me, covered, as I was, in blood.  They waited for me to speak.  
I raised my red arms to the sky and shouted in a voice like thunder.",,,,

There is something fundamentally pathetic in this kind of evil.  It smacks of the same self-delusion of would-be great men.  Look at this place: an entire palace dedicated to reinforcing a self-created image.  Look at me, it screams, I am the true face of power.  Eztli-Tenoch the god, impotent in his crystal cage.
Yet there is another side of me that understands.  A side of me that has walked these halls, that has known godhood.  I have sat by his side, judging the rabble.  I have felt our divine calling.",,,,

<knight_hero> has become quite a regular at the library.  This last month he has wanted to see practically every military treatise I could lay my hands on and, having exhausted sensible subjects, has branched out into just about anything I can pull off the shelf.
